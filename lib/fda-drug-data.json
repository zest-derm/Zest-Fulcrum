      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products including HULIO are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue HULIO if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: • Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before HULIO use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to HULIO use. • Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. • Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with HULIO prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with HULIO, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6–MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): • Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. • Discontinue HULIO if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. • Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting HULIO. • Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): • Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. • Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] • Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of patients treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient years in 7973 adalimumab treated patients versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient years in 4848 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to < 4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with Crohn’s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these patients discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 patients, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo- controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in patients treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥5% of Patients Treated with Adalimumab During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated patients in RA studies were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated patients in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of patients within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated patients were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA patients who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this patient population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in patients receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of patients and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of patients treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No patient developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of patients treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several patients. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all patients. Most patients were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this patient population was similar to the safety profile seen in patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of patients receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of patients and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . The safety profile for patients with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn’s Disease Clinical Studies Adults The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult patients with Crohn’s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult patients with Crohn’s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.10) ] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as ≥25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult patients with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . The safety profile for patients with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2. Table 2: Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations < 2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or ≥ 4 years of age and weighing < 15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) This patient received concomitant MTX NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA 48 weeks Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn’s Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn’s Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal Up to 52 weeks One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) 61% (272/445) No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12- month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

In the treatment of RA, some patients not taking concomitant MTX may derive additional benefit from increasing the dosage of HULIO to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week. 2.2 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The recommended subcutaneous dosage of HULIO for patients 2 years of age and older with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is based on weight as shown below. MTX, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, and/or analgesics may be continued during treatment with HULIO. Pediatric Weight (2 Years of Age and older) Recommended Dosage 15 kg (33 lbs) to less than 30 kg (66 lbs) 20 mg every other week 30 kg (66 lbs) and greater 40 mg every other week There is no dosage form for HULIO that allows weight-based dosing for pediatric patients below 15 kg. Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. 2.3 Crohn’s Disease Adults The recommended subcutaneous dosage of HULIO for adult patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given in one day or split over two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks later (Day 29) begin a dosage of 40 mg every other week. Aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids may be continued during treatment with HULIO. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] or MTX may be continued during treatment with HULIO if necessary. Pediatrics The recommended subcutaneous dosage of HULIO for pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with Crohn’s disease (CD) is based on body weight as shown below: Pediatric Weight Recommended Dosage Days 1 through 15 Starting on Day 29 17 kg (37 lbs) to less than 40 kg (88 lbs) Day 1: 80 mg Day 15: 40 mg 20 mg every other week 40 kg (88 lbs) and greater Day 1: 160 mg (single dose or split over two consecutive days) Day 15: 80 mg 40 mg every other week 2.4 Ulcerative Colitis Adults The recommended subcutaneous dosage of HULIO for adult patients with ulcerative colitis is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given in one day or split over two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dosage of 40 mg every other week. Discontinue HULIO in adult patients without evidence of clinical remission by eight weeks (Day 57) of therapy. Aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids may be continued during treatment with HULIO. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] may be continued during treatment with HULIO if necessary. 2.5 Plaque Psoriasis or Adult Uveitis The recommended subcutaneous dosage of HULIO for adult patients with plaque psoriasis (Ps) or Uveitis (UV) is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The use of adalimumab products in moderate to severe chronic Ps beyond one year has not been evaluated in controlled clinical studies. 2.6 Hidradenitis Suppurativa Adults The recommended subcutaneous dosage of HULIO for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an initial dose of 160 mg (given in one day or split over two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Begin 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week dosing two weeks later (Day 29). 2.7 Monitoring to Assess Safety Prior to initiating HULIO and periodically during therapy, evaluate patients for active tuberculosis and test for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.8 General Considerations for Administration HULIO is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. A patient may self-inject HULIO or a caregiver may inject HULIO using either the HULIO Pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. HULIO can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the HULIO Pen or prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. HULIO does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. Instruct patients using the HULIO Pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ]. Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products including IDACIO are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue IDACIO if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: • Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before IDACIO use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to IDACIO use. • Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti- fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. • Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with IDACIO prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with IDACIO, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6‑mercaptopurine (6–MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): • Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. • Discontinue IDACIO if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. • Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting IDACIO. • Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): • Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. • Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] • Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] • Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] • Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] • Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] • Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] • Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo- controlled trials, 20% of patients treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA‑ II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post- surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new- onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control- treated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with Crohn’s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these patients discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 patients, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo- controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in patients treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of patients within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated patients were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA patients who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this patient population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in patients receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of patients and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of patients treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No patient developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of patients treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several patients. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all patients. Most patients were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this patient population was similar to the safety profile seen in patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of patients receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of patients and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo- controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4 )] . The safety profile for patients with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn’s Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult patients with Crohn’s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years : The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric patients from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult patients with Crohn’s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.7 )] was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.8 )] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo- controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.9 )] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as ≥25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult patients with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies (Study PUV-I) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 ) ]. The safety profile for patients with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti‑adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2 .

No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

A patient may self-inject IDACIO or a caregiver may inject IDACIO using either the IDACIO Pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. IDACIO may be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the IDACIO Pen, or prefilled syringe or single dose institutional use vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. IDACIO does not contain preservatives. Therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining in the syringe. Instruct patients using the IDACIO Pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ]. Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. The IDACIO syringe plunger stopper and needle cover are not made with natural rubber latex. The IDACIO single-dose institutional use vial kit is for administration within an institutional setting only, such as a hospital, physician’s office, or clinic. Withdraw the dose using the vial adapter, the sterile syringe and needle provided. Only administer one dose per vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; discard unused portion. The IDACIO vial and syringe stopper are not made with natural rubber latex. Read these Administration Instructions before using the Idacio Vial kit. IDACIO is supplied in a carton containing 1 sterile single-use syringe, 1 sterile needle, 1 vial adapter, 2 alcohol preps and 1 glass vial providing 40 mg/0.8 mL of IDACIO ( Figure A ) The contents of the Idacio Vial Kit are for single-dose (one-time) use only. Discard unused portion. Figure A Prior to Administration • Remove the Idacio Vial Kit from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. • Check the expiration date. • Remove Vial Kit contents from the carton and inspect for damage. Do not use if any kit component or packaging has been damaged. • Check the vial contents to make sure that the liquid is clear, colorless, and free of particles and flakes. Note : Prepare syringe just prior to administration and inject immediately. Do not store Idacio in the syringe. Step 1: Prepare Vial and Vial Adapter 1.1 Remove plastic flip off cap from vial and disinfect the rubber stopper. Do not touch the top of the vial after cleaning 1.2 Without removing the vial adapter from its packaging, peel off the top cover (Figure B). Do not touch the vial adapter Figure B 1.3 With the vial adapter still in its packaging, push the vial adapter onto the vial top until it snaps in place (Figure C). Figure C 1.4 Remove the vial adapter packaging (Figure D). Figure D Step 2: Connect Syringe to Vial Adapter 2.1 Remove syringe from outer packaging. Do not touch the syringe tip. Figure E 2.2 Hold the base of the vial adapter and connect the syringe to the vial adapter by turning it clockwise (Figure E). Step 3: Withdraw the Dose 3.1 Invert the vial completely with the vial adapter and syringe still connected (Figure F). Figure F 3.2 Slowly withdraw the prescribed dose of Idacio into the syringe for administration (Figure G). Remove air bubbles from the syringe. Do not pull the plunger rod out. Figure G Step 4: Disconnect the syringe 4.1 Turn over the vial and syringe. Hold the base of the vial adapter and disconnect the syringe from the vial adapter by turning it counterclockwise (Figure H). Do not touch the syringe tip Figure H Step 5: Attach Needle Figure I 5.1 Peel open the outer needle packaging to uncover the yellow syringe connector (Figure J).

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products including YUSIMRY are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue YUSIMRY if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before YUSIMRY use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to YUSIMRY use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with YUSIMRY prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with YUSIMRY, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6–MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning . SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue YUSIMRY if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting YUSIMRY. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-808-5529 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo- controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at Week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn’s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4 ) ]. The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies Adults : The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn’s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 ) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years : The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 ) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn’s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.7 ) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.8 ) ]. The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.9 ) ]. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as ≥25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 ) ]. The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2 . Table 2. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with adalimumab Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by Elisa (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations < 2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or ≥ 4 years of age and weighing < 15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn's Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn's Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6-to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

A patient may self-inject YUSIMRY or a caregiver may inject YUSIMRY using either the YUSIMRY pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. YUSIMRY can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the YUSIMRY pen or prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. YUSIMRY does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 ) ]. Instruct patients using the YUSIMRY pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ]. Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products, including SIMLANDI, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue SIMLANDI if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before SIMLANDI use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to SIMLANDI use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with SIMLANDI prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with SIMLANDI, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. Discontinue SIMLANDI if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting SIMLANDI. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-483-8279 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn’s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn’s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥5% of Subjects Treated with Adalimumab During Placebo-Controlled Period of Pooled RA Studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous Every Other Week Placebo (N=705) (N=690) Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection 17% 13% Sinusitis 11% 9% Flu syndrome 7% 6% Gastrointestinal Nausea 9% 8% Abdominal pain 7% 4% Laboratory Tests * Laboratory test abnormal 8% 7% Hypercholesterolemia 6% 4% Hyperlipidemia 7% 5% Hematuria 5% 4% Alkaline phosphatase increased 5% 3% Other Headache 12% 8% Rash 12% 6% Accidental injury 10% 8% Injection site reaction ** 8% 1% Back pain 6% 4% Urinary tract infection 8% 5% Hypertension 5% 3% * Laboratory test abnormalities were reported as adverse reactions in European trials ** Does not include injection site erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling Less Common Adverse Reactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies Other infrequent serious adverse reactions that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions or Adverse Reaction sections that occurred at an incidence of less than 5% in adalimumab-treated subjects in RA studies (RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) were: Body As A Whole: Pain in extremity, pelvic pain, surgery, thorax pain Cardiovascular System: Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, coronary artery disorder, heart arrest, hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial infarct, palpitation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, syncope, tachycardia Digestive System: Cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic necrosis, vomiting Endocrine System: Parathyroid disorder Hemic And Lymphatic System: Agranulocytosis, polycythemia Metabolic And Nutritional Disorders: Dehydration, healing abnormal, ketosis, paraproteinemia, peripheral edema Musculo-Skeletal System: Arthritis, bone disorder, bone fracture (not spontaneous), bone necrosis, joint disorder, muscle cramps, myasthenia, pyogenic arthritis, synovitis, tendon disorder Neoplasia: Adenoma Nervous System: Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor Respiratory System: Asthma, bronchospasm, dyspnea, lung function decreased, pleural effusion Special Senses: Cataract Thrombosis: Thrombosis leg Urogenital System: Cystitis, kidney calculus, menstrual disorder Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Studies In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated subjects in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult subjects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)] . The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn’s Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn’s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6)] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn’s disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.8)] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.9)] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as ≥25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 , 14.11 )] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were <2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations <2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis a 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age b 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or ≥4 years of age and weighing <15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) c NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis d 48 weeks e 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn’s Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn’s Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis f Up to 52 weeks g 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) h 61% (272/445) i Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) j n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed) a In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy b In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy c This patient received concomitant MTX d In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA e Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. f In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal g One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study h Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied) i No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed j No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

A patient may self-inject SIMLANDI or a caregiver may inject SIMLANDI using either the SIMLANDI autoinjector or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. SIMLANDI can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. SIMLANDI does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. Instruct patients using the SIMLANDI autoinjector or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ] . Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with adalimumab products, including ABRILADA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue ABRILADA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: • Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before ABRILADA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to ABRILADA use. • Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. • Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with ABRILADA prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with ABRILADA, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6–MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS ( 5.1 , 6.1 ): • Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. • Discontinue ABRILADA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. • Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting ABRILADA. • Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. MALIGNANCY ( 5.2 ): • Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. • Post‑marketing cases of hepatosplenic T‑cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T‑cell lymphoma, have occurred in adolescent and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Hematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] • Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common adverse reactions (>10%) are: infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%). Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at Week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDs, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn's Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects. Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion. Table 1.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption. In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity. Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open-label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3 , 14.4) ] . The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV. Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies Adults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn's disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Pediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn's disease. During the 4-week open-label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions. Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies Adults : The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%). Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab. Flare of HS, defined as ≥25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies. Uveitis Clinical Studies Adalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.10) ] . The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products. There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were <2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab n: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed). Indications Study Duration Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N) Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N) In all patients who received adalimumab In patients with serum adalimumab concentrations <2 mcg/mL Rheumatoid Arthritis In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy. 6 to 12 months 5% (58/1062) NR NA Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) 4 to 17 years of age In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy. 48 weeks 16% (27/171) NR NA 2 to 4 years of age or ≥4 years of age and weighing <15 kg 24 weeks 7% (1/15) This patient received concomitant MTX. NR NA Psoriatic Arthritis In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA. 48 weeks Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments. 13% (24/178) NR NA Ankylosing Spondylitis 24 weeks 9% (16/185) NR NA Adult Crohn's Disease 56 weeks 3% (7/269) 8% (7/86) NA Pediatric Crohn's Disease 52 weeks 3% (6/182) 10% (6/58) NA Adult Ulcerative Colitis 52 weeks 5% (19/360) 21% (19/92) NA Plaque Psoriasis In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal. Up to 52 weeks One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study. 8% (77/920) 21% (77/372) NA Hidradenitis Suppurativa 36 weeks 7% (30/461) 28% (58/207) Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied). 61% (272/445) No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed. Non-infectious Uveitis 52 weeks 5% (12/249) 21% (12/57) 40% (99/249) No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure. • Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis • General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia • Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis • Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis • Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) • Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome), cerebrovascular accident • Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism • Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction • Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"

Pediatric Weight (2 years of age and older) Recommended Dosage 10 kg (22 lbs) to less than 15 kg (33 lbs) 10 mg every other week 15 kg (33 lbs) to less than 30 kg (66 lbs) 20 mg every other week 30 kg (66 lbs) and greater 40 mg every other week Adalimumab products have not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Crohn's Disease Subcutaneous Adult Dosage Regimen The recommended subcutaneous dosage of ABRILADA for adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given in one day or split over two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks later (Day 29) begin a dosage of 40 mg every other week. Aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids may be continued during treatment with ABRILADA. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] or MTX may be continued during treatment with ABRILADA if necessary. Subcutaneous Pediatric Dosage Regimen The recommended subcutaneous dosage of ABRILADA for pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD), based on body weight, is shown below: Pediatric Weight Recommended Dosage Days 1 through 15 Starting on Day 29 17 kg (37 lbs) to less than 40 kg (88 lbs) Day 1: 80 mg Day 15: 40 mg 20 mg every other week 40 kg (88 lbs) and greater Day 1: 160 mg (single dose or split over two consecutive days) Day 15: 80 mg 40 mg every other week 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Ulcerative Colitis Subcutaneous Adult Dosage Regimen The recommended subcutaneous dosage of ABRILADA for adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given in one day or split over two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dosage of 40 mg every other week. Discontinue ABRILADA in adult patients without evidence of clinical remission by eight weeks (Day 57) of therapy. Aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids may be continued during treatment with ABRILADA. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] may be continued during treatment with ABRILADA if necessary. 2.6 Recommended Dosage in Plaque Psoriasis or Adults with Uveitis The recommended subcutaneous dosage of ABRILADA for adult patients with plaque psoriasis (Ps) or uveitis (UV) [see Indications and Usage (1.7 , 1.9) ] is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The use of adalimumab products in moderate to severe chronic Ps beyond one year has not been evaluated in controlled clinical studies. 2.7 Recommended Dosage in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Subcutaneous Adult Dosage Regimen The recommended subcutaneous dosage of ABRILADA for adult patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an initial dose of 160 mg (given in one day or split over two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Begin 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week dosing two weeks later (Day 29). 2.8 General Considerations for Administration ABRILADA is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. A patient may self-inject ABRILADA or a caregiver may inject ABRILADA using either the ABRILADA pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. ABRILADA can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the ABRILADA pen, prefilled syringe, or single-dose institutional use vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates or discolorations are noted, do not use the product. ABRILADA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Instruct patients using the ABRILADA pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use]. Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. The ABRILADA single-dose institutional use vial is for administration within an institutional setting only, such as a hospital, physician's office or clinic. Withdraw the dose using a sterile needle and syringe and administer promptly by a healthcare provider within an institutional setting. Only administer one dose per vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCIES WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCIES See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. SERIOUS INFECTIONS Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis), and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. ( 5.1 ) Enbrel should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting Enbrel. ( 5.1 ) Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. ( 5.1 ) MALIGNANCIES Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF-blockers, including Enbrel. ( 5.3 ) SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with Enbrel are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Enbrel should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent tuberculosis before Enbrel use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent infection prior to Enbrel use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. The risks and benefits of treatment with Enbrel should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Enbrel, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. MALIGNANCIES Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF-blockers, including Enbrel."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Patients with Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hematologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hepatitis B Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Allergic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5%): infections and injection site reactions. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Inc. at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Across clinical studies and postmarketing experience, the most serious adverse reactions with Enbrel were infections, neurologic events, CHF, and hematologic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . The most common adverse reactions with Enbrel were infections and injection site reactions. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, or Plaque Psoriasis The data described below reflect exposure to Enbrel in 2219 adult patients with RA followed for up to 80 months, in 182 patients with PsA for up to 24 months, in 138 patients with AS for up to 6 months, and in 1204 adult patients with PsO for up to 18 months. In controlled trials, the proportion of Enbrel-treated patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was approximately 4% in the indications studied. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients In general, the adverse reactions in pediatric patients were similar in frequency and type as those seen in adult patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) , and Clinical Studies (14.2 , 14.6) ] . In a 48-week clinical study in 211 children aged 4 to 17 years with pediatric PsO, the adverse reactions reported were similar to those seen in previous studies in adults with PsO. Long-term safety profile for up to 264 additional weeks was assessed in an open-label extension study and no new safety signals were identified. In open-label clinical studies of children with JIA, adverse reactions reported in those ages 2 to 4 years were similar to adverse reactions reported in older children. Infections Infections, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, have been observed in adult and pediatric patients. Infections have been noted in all body systems and have been reported in patients receiving Enbrel alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In controlled portions of trials, the types and severity of infection were similar between Enbrel and the respective control group (placebo or MTX for RA and PsA patients) in RA, PsA, AS and PsO patients. Rates of infections in RA and adult PsO patients are provided in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. Infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis and influenza. In controlled portions of trials in RA, PsA, AS and PsO, the rates of serious infection were similar (0.8% in placebo, 3.6% in MTX, and 1.4% in Enbrel/Enbrel + MTX-treated groups). In clinical trials in rheumatologic indications, serious infections experienced by patients have included, but are not limited to, pneumonia, cellulitis, septic arthritis, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, pyelonephritis, sepsis, abscess and osteomyelitis. In clinical trials in adult PsO patients, serious infections experienced by patients have included, but are not limited to, pneumonia, cellulitis, gastroenteritis, abscess and osteomyelitis. The rate of serious infections was not increased in open-label extension trials and was similar to that observed in Enbrel- and placebo-treated patients from controlled trials. In 66 global clinical trials of 17,505 patients (21,015 patient-years of therapy), tuberculosis was observed in approximately 0.02% of patients. In 17,696 patients (27,169 patient-years of therapy) from 38 clinical trials and 4 cohort studies in the U.S. and Canada, tuberculosis was observed in approximately 0.006% of patients. These studies include reports of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . The types of infections reported in pediatric patients with PsO and JIA were generally mild and consistent with those commonly seen in the general pediatric population. Two JIA patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Injection Site Reactions In placebo-controlled trials in rheumatologic indications, approximately 37% of patients treated with Enbrel developed injection site reactions. In controlled trials in patients with PsO, 15% of adult patients and 7% of pediatric patients treated with Enbrel developed injection site reactions during the first 3 months of treatment. All injection site reactions were described as mild to moderate (erythema, itching, pain, swelling, bleeding, bruising) and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. Injection site reactions generally occurred in the first month and subsequently decreased in frequency. The mean duration of injection site reactions was 3 to 5 days. Seven percent of patients experienced redness at a previous injection site when subsequent injections were given. Other Adverse Reactions Table 3 summarizes adverse reactions reported in adult RA patients. The types of adverse reactions seen in patients with PsA or AS were similar to the types of adverse reactions seen in patients with RA. Table 3.

Table 4 summarizes adverse reactions reported in adult PsO patients from Studies I and II. Table 4. Percent of Adult PsO Patients Experiencing Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Portions of Clinical Trials (Studies I & II) Placebo (N = 359) Enbrel Includes 25 mg subcutaneous (SC) once weekly (QW), 25 mg SC twice weekly (BIW), 50 mg SC QW, and 50 mg SC BIW doses.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to etanercept in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Immunogenicity Patients with RA, PsA, AS or PsO were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to etanercept. Antibodies to the TNF receptor portion or other protein components of the Enbrel drug product were detected at least once in sera of approximately 6% of adult patients with RA, PsA, AS or PsO. These antibodies were all non-neutralizing. Results from JIA patients were similar to those seen in adult RA patients treated with Enbrel. In adult PsO studies that evaluated the exposure of etanercept for up to 120 weeks, the percentage of patients testing positive at the assessed time points of 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks ranged from 3.6%-8.7% and were all non-neutralizing. The percentage of patients testing positive increased with an increase in the duration of study; however, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events was observed. The immunogenicity data of Enbrel beyond 120 weeks of exposure are unknown. In pediatric PsO studies, approximately 10% of subjects developed antibodies to etanercept by Week 48 and approximately 16% of subjects developed antibodies to etanercept by Week 264. All of these antibodies were non-neutralizing. However, because of the limitations of the immunogenicity assays, the incidence of binding and neutralizing antibodies may not have been reliably determined. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to etanercept in an ELISA assay, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Autoantibodies Patients with RA had serum samples tested for autoantibodies at multiple time points. In RA Studies I and II, the percentage of patients evaluated for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) who developed new positive ANA (titer ≥ 1:40) was higher in patients treated with Enbrel (11%) than in placebo-treated patients (5%). The percentage of patients who developed new positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies was also higher by radioimmunoassay (15% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients) and by Crithidia luciliae assay (3% of patients treated with Enbrel compared to none of placebo-treated patients). The proportion of patients treated with Enbrel who developed anticardiolipin antibodies was similarly increased compared to placebo-treated patients. In RA Study III, no pattern of increased autoantibody development was seen in Enbrel patients compared to MTX patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been reported during post approval use of Enbrel in adults and pediatric patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Enbrel exposure. Adverse reactions are listed by body system below: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, aplastic anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac disorders: congestive heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Gastrointestinal disorders: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) General disorders: angioedema, chest pain Hepatobiliary disorders: autoimmune hepatitis, elevated transaminases, hepatitis B reactivation Immune disorders: macrophage activation syndrome, systemic vasculitis, sarcoidosis Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: lupus-like syndrome Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified: melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, Merkel cell carcinoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Nervous system disorders: convulsions, multiple sclerosis, demyelination, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, paresthesias, headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Ocular disorders: uveitis, scleritis Renal and urinary disorders: glomerulonephritis Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: interstitial lung disease Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: cutaneous lupus erythematosus, cutaneous vasculitis (including leukocytoclastic vasculitis), erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, subcutaneous nodule, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar) Opportunistic infections, including atypical mycobacterial infection, herpes zoster, aspergillosis and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and protozoal infections have also been reported in postmarketing use. Rare (< 0.1%) cases of IBD have been reported in JIA patients receiving Enbrel, which is not effective for the treatment of IBD."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Enbrel is administered by subcutaneous injection. Patient Population Recommended Dose and Frequency Adult RA and PsA ( 2.3 ) 50 mg once weekly with or without methotrexate (MTX) AS ( 2.3 ) 50 mg once weekly Adult PsO ( 2.3 ) 50 mg twice weekly for 3 months, followed by 50 mg once weekly pJIA, Pediatric PsO and JPsA ( 2.4 ) 0.8 mg/kg weekly, with a maximum of 50 mg per week 2.1 Testing and Procedures Prior to Treatment Initiation Perform the following evaluations and procedures prior to initiating treatment with Enbrel: Prior to initiating Enbrel and periodically during therapy, evaluate patients for active tuberculosis and test for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Complete all age-appropriate vaccinations as recommended by current immunization guidelines prior to initiating treatment with Enbrel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. 2.2 Important Administration Instructions Administration of one 50 mg Enbrel single - dose prefilled syringe, one single - dose prefilled Enbrel SureClick autoinjector, or one Enbrel Mini single - dose prefilled cartridge (for use with the AutoTouch reusable autoinjector only), provides a dose equivalent to two 25 mg Enbrel single-dose prefilled syringes, two 25 mg single - dose vials, or two multiple-dose vials of lyophilized Enbrel, when multiple - dose vials are reconstituted and administered as recommended. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Plaque Psoriasis Enbrel is administered by subcutaneous injection (Table 1). Table 1. Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients with RA, AS, PsA and PsO Patient Population Recommended Dosage Adult RA, AS, and PsA 50 mg weekly Adult PsO Starting Dose : 50 mg twice weekly for 3 months Maintenance Dose : 50 mg once weekly See the Enbrel (etanercept) \"Instructions for Use\" insert for detailed information on injection site selection and dose administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, and Psoriatic Arthritis Patients Methotrexate, glucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or analgesics may be continued during treatment with Enbrel. Based on a study of 50 mg Enbrel twice weekly in patients with RA that suggested higher incidence of adverse reactions but similar American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates, doses higher than 50 mg per week are not recommended. Adult Plaque Psoriasis Patients In addition to the 50 mg twice weekly recommended starting dose, starting doses of 25 mg or 50 mg per week were shown to be efficacious. The proportion of responders was related to Enbrel dosage [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Plaque Psoriasis, and Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis The recommended weight-based dosage for pediatric patients is administered by subcutaneous injection (Table 2). Table 2. Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients with pJIA, PsO and JPsA Body Weight Recommended Dosage 63 kg (138 pounds) or more 50 mg weekly Less than 63 kg (138 pounds) 0.8 mg/kg weekly To achieve pediatric doses other than 25 mg or 50 mg, use Enbrel solution in a single-dose vial or reconstituted lyophilized powder in a multiple-dose vial. Dosages of Enbrel higher than those described in Table 2 have not been studied in pediatric patients. In pJIA patients, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, or analgesics may be continued during treatment with Enbrel. 2.5 Preparation Instructions for Enbrel Enbrel is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. Patients may self-inject when deemed appropriate and if they receive medical follow-up, as necessary. Patients should not self-administer until they receive proper training in how to prepare and administer the correct dose. Administer injections subcutaneously in the thigh, abdomen or outer area of the upper arm. The Enbrel devices are not made with natural rubber latex. The Enbrel (etanercept) \"Instructions for Use\" insert for each presentation contains more detailed instructions on injection site selection and the preparation of Enbrel. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Prefilled Syringe For a more comfortable injection, leave Enbrel prefilled syringes at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. When using the Enbrel single-dose prefilled syringe, check to see if the amount of liquid in the prefilled syringe falls between the two purple fill level indicator lines on the syringe. If the syringe does not have the right amount of liquid, DO NOT USE THAT SYRINGE. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Prefilled SureClick Autoinjector Leave the autoinjector at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Vial For a more comfortable injection, leave Enbrel vial(s) at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the vial cap while allowing the vial to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. When using the Enbrel single-dose vial, administer the correct dose of solution using the following recommended materials: A 1 mL Luer-Lock syringe. A withdrawal needle with Luer-Lock connection, sterile, 22-gauge, length 1 ½ inch. An injection needle with Luer-Lock connection, sterile, 27-gauge, length ½ inch. Two vials may be required to administer the total prescribed dose. Use the same syringe for each vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions. Preparation of Enbrel Lyophilized Powder in a Multiple-dose Vial Enbrel lyophilized powder should be reconstituted aseptically with 1 mL of the supplied Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol), giving a solution of 1 mL containing 25 mg of Enbrel. A vial adapter is supplied for use when reconstituting the lyophilized powder. However, the vial adapter should not be used if multiple doses are going to be withdrawn from the vial. If the vial will be used for multiple doses, a 25-gauge needle should be used for reconstituting and withdrawing Enbrel, and the supplied \"Mixing Date:\" sticker should be attached to the vial and the date of reconstitution entered. Reconstituted solution must be refrigerated at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) and used within 14 days. Discard reconstituted solution after 14 days because product stability and sterility cannot be assured after 14 days. DO NOT store reconstituted Enbrel solution at room temperature. For a more comfortable injection, leave the Enbrel dose tray at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. If using the vial adapter, twist the vial adapter onto the diluent syringe. Then, place the vial adapter over the Enbrel vial and insert the vial adapter into the vial stopper. Push down on the plunger to inject the diluent into the Enbrel vial. If using a 25-gauge needle to reconstitute and withdraw Enbrel, the diluent should be injected very slowly into the Enbrel vial. It is normal for some foaming to occur. Keeping the diluent syringe in place, gently swirl the contents of the Enbrel vial during dissolution. To avoid excessive foaming, do not shake or vigorously agitate. Generally, dissolution of Enbrel takes less than 10 minutes. Do not use the solution if discolored or cloudy, or if particulate matter remains. Withdraw the correct dose of reconstituted solution into the syringe. Some foam or bubbles may remain in the vial. Remove the syringe from the vial adapter or remove the 25-gauge needle from the syringe. Attach a 27-gauge needle to inject Enbrel. The contents of one vial of Enbrel solution should not be mixed with, or transferred into, the contents of another vial of Enbrel. No other medications should be added to solutions containing Enbrel, and do not reconstitute Enbrel with other diluents. Do not filter reconstituted solution during preparation or administration. Preparation of Enbrel Mini ® single-dose prefilled cartridge using the AutoTouch ® reusable autoinjector Leave Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the purple cap while allowing the cartridge to reach room temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. To use AutoTouch reusable autoinjector, open the door by pushing the door button and inserting Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge into AutoTouch. When inserted correctly, Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge will slide freely and completely into the door. Close the door and AutoTouch reusable autoinjector is ready for injection."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis) and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. ( 5.1 ) Discontinue REMICADE if a patient develops a serious infection. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting REMICADE. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. ( 5.1 ) Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including REMICADE. ( 5.2 ) Postmarketing cases of fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including REMICADE. Almost all had received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of REMICADE cases were reported in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, most of whom were adolescent or young adult males. ( 5.2 ) SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with REMICADE are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. REMICADE should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before REMICADE use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to REMICADE use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. The risks and benefits of treatment with REMICADE should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with REMICADE, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including REMICADE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including REMICADE. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported REMICADE cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>10%) – infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis, and pharyngitis), infusion-related reactions, headache, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Biotech, Inc. at 1-800-526-7736 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Adults The data described herein reflect exposure to REMICADE in 4779 adult patients (1304 patients with RA, 1106 patients with CD, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 484 with UC, 1373 with Ps, and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2625 patients exposed beyond 30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1 year. [For information on adverse reactions in pediatric patients see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. One of the most-common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (e.g., dyspnea, flushing, headache and rash). Infusion-Related Reactions Adverse Reactions During or Shortly After Infusion An infusion reaction was defined in clinical trials as any adverse event occurring during an infusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In all the clinical studies, approximately 20% of REMICADE-treated patients experienced an infusion reaction compared with 10% of placebo-treated patients. Of REMICADE-treated patients who had an infusion reaction during the induction period, 27% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Of patients who did not have an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Among all REMICADE infusions, 3% were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as fever or chills, 1% were accompanied by cardiopulmonary reactions (primarily chest pain, hypotension, hypertension or dyspnea), and <1% were accompanied by pruritus, urticaria, or the combined symptoms of pruritus/urticaria and cardiopulmonary reactions. Serious infusion reactions occurred in <1% of patients and included anaphylaxis, convulsions, erythematous rash and hypotension. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued REMICADE because of infusion reactions, and all patients recovered with treatment and/or discontinuation of the infusion. REMICADE infusions beyond the initial infusion were not associated with a higher incidence of reactions. The infusion reaction rates remained stable in Ps through 1 year in Ps Study I. In psoriasis Study II, the rates were variable over time and somewhat higher following the final infusion than after the initial infusion. Across the 3 Ps studies, the percent of total infusions resulting in infusion reactions (i.e., an adverse event occurring within 1 hour) was 7% in the 3 mg/kg group, 4% in the 5 mg/kg group, and 1% in the placebo group. Patients who became positive for antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately two-to three-fold) to have an infusion reaction than were those who were negative. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to reduce the frequency of both antibodies to infliximab and infusion reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Infusion Reactions Following Re-administration In a clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe Ps designed to assess the efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of REMICADE following disease flare, 4% (8/219) of patients in the re-treatment induction therapy arm experienced serious infusion reactions versus <1% (1/222) in the maintenance therapy arm. Patients enrolled in this trial did not receive any concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In this study, the majority of serious infusion reactions occurred during the second infusion at Week 2. Symptoms included, but were not limited to, dyspnea, urticaria, facial edema, and hypotension. In all cases, REMICADE treatment was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Delayed Reactions/Reactions Following Re-administration In Ps studies, approximately 1% of REMICADE-treated patients experienced a possible delayed hypersensitivity reaction, generally reported as serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever and/or rash. These reactions generally occurred within 2 weeks after repeat infusion. Infections In REMICADE clinical studies, treated infections were reported in 36% of REMICADE-treated patients (average of 51 weeks of follow-up) and in 25% of placebo-treated patients (average of 37 weeks of follow-up). The infections most frequently reported were respiratory tract infections (including sinusitis, pharyngitis, and bronchitis) and urinary tract infections. Among REMICADE-treated patients, serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, skin ulceration, sepsis, and bacterial infection. In clinical trials, 7 opportunistic infections were reported; 2 cases each of coccidioidomycosis (1 case was fatal) and histoplasmosis (1 case was fatal), and 1 case each of pneumocystosis, nocardiosis and cytomegalovirus. Tuberculosis (TB) was reported in 14 patients, 4 of whom died due to miliary tuberculosis. Other cases of TB, including disseminated TB, also have been reported post-marketing. Most of these cases of TB occurred within the first 2 months after initiation of therapy with REMICADE and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the 1-year placebo-controlled studies RA I and RA II, 5.3% of patients receiving REMICADE every 8 weeks with MTX developed serious infections as compared to 3.4% of placebo patients receiving MTX. Of 924 patients receiving REMICADE, 1.7% developed pneumonia and 0.4% developed TB, when compared to 0.3% and 0.0% in the placebo arm respectively. In a shorter (22-week) placebo-controlled study of 1082 RA patients randomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg REMICADE infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks with MTX, serious infections were more frequent in the 10 mg/kg REMICADE group (5.3%) than the 3 mg/kg or placebo groups (1.7% in both). During the 54-week Crohn's II Study, 15% of patients with fistulizing CD developed a new fistula-related abscess. In REMICADE clinical studies in patients with UC, infections treated with antimicrobials were reported in 27% of REMICADE-treated patients (average of 41 weeks of follow-up) and in 18% of placebo-treated patients (average 32 weeks of follow-up). The types of infections, including serious infections, reported in patients with UC were similar to those reported in other clinical studies. The onset of serious infections may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, and fatigue. The majority of serious infections, however, may also be preceded by signs or symptoms localized to the site of the infection. Autoantibodies/Lupus-like Syndrome Approximately half of REMICADE-treated patients in clinical trials who were antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative at baseline developed a positive ANA during the trial compared with approximately one-fifth of placebo-treated patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were newly detected in approximately one-fifth of REMICADE-treated patients compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. Reports of lupus and lupus-like syndromes, however, remain uncommon. Malignancies In controlled trials, more REMICADE-treated patients developed malignancies than placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In a randomized controlled clinical trial exploring the use of REMICADE in patients with moderate to severe COPD who were either current smokers or ex-smokers, 157 patients were treated with REMICADE at doses similar to those used in RA and CD. Of these REMICADE-treated patients, 9 developed a malignancy, including 1 lymphoma, for a rate of 7.67 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 3.51 – 14.56). There was 1 reported malignancy among 77 control patients for a rate of 1.63 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 0.04 – 9.10). The majority of the malignancies developed in the lung or head and neck [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Adverse Reactions in Patients with NYHA Class III/IV Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind study evaluating REMICADE in moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of REMICADE 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg REMICADE dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg REMICADE group had died compared with 4 deaths each in the 5 mg/kg REMICADE and the placebo groups. There were trends toward increased dyspnea, hypotension, angina, and dizziness in both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg REMICADE treatment groups, versus placebo. REMICADE has not been studied in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA Class I/II) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including acute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving REMICADE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has occurred in patients receiving TNF blockers, including REMICADE, who are chronic carriers of this virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . In clinical trials in RA, CD, UC, AS, Ps, and PsA, elevations of aminotransferases were observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving REMICADE than in controls (Table 1), both when REMICADE was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In general, patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of REMICADE, or modification of concomitant medications. Table 1: Proportion of Patients with Elevated ALT in Clinical Trials in Adults Proportion of patients with elevated ALT >1 to <3 × ULN ≥3 × ULN ≥5 × ULN Placebo REMICADE Placebo REMICADE Placebo REMICADE Rheumatoid arthritis Placebo patients received methotrexate while REMICADE patients received both REMICADE and methotrexate. Median follow-up was 58 weeks. 24% 34% 3% 4% <1% <1% Crohn's disease Placebo patients in the 2 Phase 3 trials in CD received an initial dose of 5 mg/kg REMICADE at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase. Patients who were randomized to the placebo maintenance group and then later crossed over to REMICADE are included in the REMICADE group in ALT analysis. Median follow-up was 54 weeks. 34% 39% 4% 5% 0% 2% Ulcerative colitis Median follow-up was 30 weeks. Specifically, the median duration of follow-up was 30 weeks for placebo and 31 weeks for REMICADE. 12% 17% 1% 2% <1% <1% Ankylosing spondylitis Median follow-up was 24 weeks for the placebo group and 102 weeks for the REMICADE group. 15% 51% 0% 10% 0% 4% Psoriatic arthritis Median follow-up was 39 weeks for the REMICADE group and 18 weeks for the placebo group. 16% 50% 0% 7% 0% 2% Plaque psoriasis ALT values are obtained in 2 Phase 3 Ps studies with median follow-up of 50 weeks for REMICADE and 16 weeks for placebo. 24% 49% <1% 8% 0% 3% Adverse Reactions in Psoriasis Studies During the placebo-controlled portion across the 3 clinical trials up to Week 16, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined as resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg REMICADE group, 1.9% in the placebo group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg REMICADE group. Among patients in the 2 Phase 3 studies, 12.4% of patients receiving REMICADE 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE in Study I. In Study II, 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving REMICADE 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively, through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE. One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg REMICADE. Serious infections included sepsis, and abscesses. In Study I, 2.7% of patients receiving REMICADE 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. In Study II, 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving REMICADE 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through 1 year of treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. The most common serious infection (requiring hospitalization) was abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by 5 (0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg REMICADE group. Two active cases of tuberculosis were reported: 6 weeks and 34 weeks after starting REMICADE. In the placebo-controlled portion of the Ps studies, 7 of 1123 patients who received REMICADE at any dose were diagnosed with at least one NMSC compared to 0 of 334 patients who received placebo. In the Ps studies, 1% (15/1373) of patients experienced serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever, and/or rash, usually early in the treatment course. Of these patients, 6 required hospitalization due to fever, severe myalgia, arthralgia, swollen joints, and immobility. Other Adverse Reactions in Adults Safety data are available from 4779 REMICADE-treated adult patients, including 1304 with RA, 1106 with CD, 484 with UC, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 1373 with Ps and 17 with other conditions. [For information on other adverse reactions in pediatric patients, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of all patients with RA receiving 4 or more infusions are in Table 2. The types and frequencies of adverse reactions observed were similar in REMICADE-treated RA, AS, PsA, Ps, and CD patients except for abdominal pain, which occurred in 26% of REMICADE-treated patients with CD. In the CD studies, there were insufficient numbers and duration of follow-up for patients who never received REMICADE to provide meaningful comparisons. Table 2: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in ≥ 5% of Patients who Received ≥ 4 REMICADE Infusions for RA Placebo REMICADE (n=350) (n=1129) Average weeks of follow-up 59 weeks 66 weeks Upper respiratory tract infection 25% 32% Nausea 20% 21% Headache 14% 18% Sinusitis 8% 14% Diarrhea 12% 12% Abdominal pain 8% 12% Pharyngitis 8% 12% Coughing 8% 12% Bronchitis 9% 10% Rash 5% 10% Dyspepsia 7% 10% Fatigue 7% 9% Urinary tract infection 6% 8% Pain 7% 8% Arthralgia 7% 8% Pruritus 2% 7% Fever 4% 7% Hypertension 5% 7% Moniliasis 3% 5% The most common serious adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Other serious, medically relevant adverse reactions ≥0.2% or clinically significant adverse reactions by body system were as follows: Body as a whole : allergic reaction, edema Blood : pancytopenia Cardiovascular : hypotension Gastrointestinal : constipation, intestinal obstruction Central and Peripheral Nervous : dizziness Heart Rate and Rhythm : bradycardia Liver and Biliary : hepatitis Metabolic and Nutritional : dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting : thrombocytopenia Neoplasms : lymphoma Red Blood Cell : anemia, hemolytic anemia Resistance Mechanism : cellulitis, sepsis, serum sickness, sarcoidosis Respiratory : lower respiratory tract infection (including pneumonia), pleurisy, pulmonary edema Skin and Appendages : increased sweating Vascular (Extracardiac) : thrombophlebitis White Cell and Reticuloendothelial : leukopenia, lymphadenopathy Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease There were some differences in the adverse reactions observed in the pediatric patients receiving REMICADE compared to those observed in adults with CD. These differences are discussed in the following paragraphs. The following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in 103 randomized pediatric CD patients administered 5 mg/kg REMICADE through 54 weeks than in 385 adult CD patients receiving a similar treatment regimen: anemia (11%), leukopenia (9%), flushing (9%), viral infection (8%), neutropenia (7%), bone fracture (7%), bacterial infection (6%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (6%). Infections were reported in 56% of randomized pediatric patients in Study Peds Crohn's and in 50% of adult patients in Study Crohn's I. In Study Peds Crohn's, infections were reported more frequently for patients who received every 8-week as opposed to every 12-week infusions (74% and 38%, respectively), while serious infections were reported for 3 patients in the every 8-week and 4 patients in the every 12-week maintenance treatment group. The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious infection was abscess. Pneumonia was reported for 3 patients, (2 in the every 8-week and 1 in the every 12-week maintenance treatment groups). Herpes zoster was reported for 2 patients in the every 8-week maintenance treatment group. In Study Peds Crohn's, 18% of randomized patients experienced 1 or more infusion reactions, with no notable difference between treatment groups. Of the 112 patients in Study Peds Crohn's, there were no serious infusion reactions, and 2 patients had non-serious anaphylactoid reactions. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 18% of pediatric patients in CD clinical trials; 4% had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 1% had elevations ≥5 × ULN. (Median follow-up was 53 weeks). Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Overall, the adverse reactions reported in the pediatric UC trial and adult UC (Study UC I and Study UC II) studies were generally consistent. In a pediatric UC trial, the most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, fever, and headache. Infections were reported in 31 (52%) of 60 treated patients in the pediatric UC trial and 22 (37%) required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with infections in the pediatric UC trial was similar to that in the pediatric CD study (Study Peds Crohn's) but higher than the proportion in the adults' UC studies (Study UC I and Study UC II). The overall incidence of infections in the pediatric UC trial was 13/22 (59%) in the every 8 week maintenance treatment group. Upper respiratory tract infection (7/60 [12%]) and pharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently reported respiratory system infections. Serious infections were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 17% (10/60) of pediatric patients in the pediatric UC trial; 7% (4/60) had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 2% (1/60) had elevations ≥5 × ULN (median follow-up was 49 weeks). Overall, 8 of 60 (13%) treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions, including 4 of 22 (18%) patients in the every 8-week treatment maintenance group. No serious infusion reactions were reported. In the pediatric UC trial, 45 patients were in the 12 to 17 year age group and 15 in the 6 to 11 year age group. The numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to make any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events. There were higher proportions of patients with serious adverse events (40% vs. 18%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (40% vs. 16%) in the younger age group than in the older age group. While the proportion of patients with infections was also higher in the younger age group (60% vs. 49%), for serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two age groups (13% in the 6 to 11 year age group vs. 11% in the 12 to 17 year age group). Overall proportions of adverse reactions, including infusion reactions, were similar between the 6 to 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups (13%). 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other infliximab products may be misleading. Treatment with REMICADE can be associated with the development of antibodies to infliximab. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method was originally used to measure anti-infliximab antibodies in clinical studies of REMICADE. The EIA method is subject to interference by serum infliximab, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the rate of patient antibody formation. A separate, drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method for detecting antibodies to infliximab was subsequently developed and validated. This method is 60-fold more sensitive than the original EIA. With the ECLIA method, all clinical samples can be classified as either positive or negative for antibodies to infliximab without the need for the inconclusive category. The incidence of antibodies to infliximab was based on the original EIA method in all clinical studies of REMICADE except for the Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with UC where the incidence of antibodies to infliximab was detected using both the EIA and ECLIA methods. Immunogenicity in Adult Patients The incidence of antibodies to infliximab in patients with RA and CD given a 3-dose induction regimen followed by maintenance dosing was approximately 10% as assessed through 1 to 2 years of REMICADE treatment. A higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab was observed in CD patients receiving REMICADE after drug-free intervals >16 weeks. In a PsA study in which 191 patients received 5 mg/kg with or without MTX, antibodies to infliximab occurred in 15% of patients. The majority of antibody-positive patients had low titers. Antibody development was lower among RA and CD patients receiving immunosuppressant therapies such as 6-MP/AZA or MTX. Patients who were antibody-positive were more likely to have higher rates of clearance, have reduced efficacy, and to experience an infusion reaction than were patients who were antibody negative [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In the Ps Study II, which included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 36% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year, and in 51% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year. In the Ps Study III, which also included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 20% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (weeks 0, 2 and 6), and in 27% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg induction. Despite the increase in antibody formation, the infusion reaction rates in Studies I and II in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction followed by every 8 week maintenance for 1 year and in Study III in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (14.1%–23.0%) and serious infusion reaction rates (<1%) were similar to those observed in other study populations. The clinical significance of apparent increased immunogenicity on efficacy and infusion reactions in Ps patients as compared to patients with other diseases treated with REMICADE over the long term is not known. Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease In Study Peds Crohn's, in which all patients received stable doses of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, excluding inconclusive samples, 3 of 24 patients had antibodies to infliximab. Although 105 patients were tested for antibodies to infliximab, 81 patients were classified as inconclusive because they could not be ruled as negative due to assay interference by the presence of infliximab in the sample. Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis In the pediatric UC trial, 58 patients were evaluated for antibodies to infliximab using the EIA as well as the drug-tolerant ECLIA. With the EIA, 4 of 58 (7%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. With the ECLIA, 30 of 58 (52%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. The higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab by the ECLIA method was due to the 60-fold higher sensitivity compared to the EIA method. While EIA-positive patients generally had undetectable trough infliximab concentrations, ECLIA-positive patients could have detectable trough concentrations of infliximab because the ECLIA assay is more sensitive and drug-tolerant. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions, some with fatal outcomes, have been identified during post approval use of REMICADE in adult and pediatric patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing Adverse Reactions in Adults and Pediatric Patients Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , agranulocytosis (including infants exposed in utero to infliximab), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Interstitial lung disease (including pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial pneumonitis and rapidly progressive disease). Pericardial effusion, systemic and cutaneous vasculitis. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), worsening psoriasis (all subtypes including pustular, primarily palmoplantar), lichenoid reactions. Peripheral demyelinating disorders (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy) transverse myelitis, and neuropathies (additional neurologic reactions have also been observed) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] and vaccine breakthrough infection including bovine tuberculosis (disseminated BCG infection) following vaccination in an infant exposed in utero to infliximab [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. Malignancies, including leukemia, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema and severe bronchospasm, and seizure have been associated with REMICADE administration. Transient visual loss have been reported in association with REMICADE during or within 2 hours of infusion. Cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial ischemia/infarction (some fatal), and arrhythmia occurring within 24 hours of initiation of infusion have also been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . New onset immune disorders (e.g., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease). Postmarketing Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients The following serious adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience in pediatric patients: infections (some fatal) including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, infusion reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, malignancies, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , transient hepatic enzyme abnormalities, lupus-like syndromes, and the development of autoantibodies."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity) that occur during infusion and shortly after infusion. ( 2.11 ) REMICADE is administered by intravenous infusion for at least 2 hours with an in-line filter ( 2.11 ) Crohn's Disease : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Some adult patients who initially respond to treatment may benefit from increasing the dose to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks if they later lose their response. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric Crohn's Disease (≥ 6 years old) : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.2 ) Ulcerative Colitis : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.3 ) Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis (≥ 6 years old) : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.4 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis : In conjunction with methotrexate, 3 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Some patients may benefit from increasing the dose up to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks or treating as often as every 4 weeks. ( 2.5 ) Ankylosing Spondylitis : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 6 weeks. ( 2.6 ) Psoriatic Arthritis and Plaque Psoriasis : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.7 , 2.8 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Crohn's Disease The recommended dosage of REMICADE is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active CD or fistulizing CD. For adult patients who respond and then lose their response, consideration may be given to treatment with 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Patients who do not respond by Week 14 are unlikely to respond with continued dosing and consideration should be given to discontinue REMICADE in these patients. 2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Crohn's Disease The recommended dosage of REMICADE for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active CD is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. 2.3 Dosage in Adult Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dosage of REMICADE is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. 2.4 Dosage in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dosage of REMICADE for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active UC is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. 2.5 Dosage in Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage of REMICADE is 3 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. REMICADE should be given in combination with methotrexate. For patients who have an incomplete response, consideration may be given to adjusting the dosage up to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks or treating as often as every 4 weeks bearing in mind that risk of serious infections is increased at higher doses per infusion or more frequent dosing [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.6 Dosage in Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosage of REMICADE is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks thereafter for the treatment of active AS. 2.7 Dosage in Psoriatic Arthritis The recommended dosage of REMICADE is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of PsA. REMICADE can be used with or without methotrexate. 2.8 Dosage in Plaque Psoriasis The recommended dosage of REMICADE in adult patients is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of chronic severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling) Ps. 2.9 Assessment for Latent and Active Tuberculosis Prior to initiating REMICADE and periodically during therapy, patients should be evaluated for active tuberculosis and tested for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.10 Administration Instructions Regarding Infusion Reactions Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, other reactions) that occur during infusion and shortly after infusion. Prior to infusion with REMICADE, patients may be premedicated with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . For mild to moderate reactions during the infusion, consider slowing or stopping the infusion. Upon resolution of these reactions, may reinitiate at a lower infusion rate and/or with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids. Discontinue the infusion if the mild to moderate reactions reoccur. Discontinue the infusion if severe hypersensitivity reactions occur during the infusion. 2.11 Reconstitution, Dilution, and Administration Instructions REMICADE is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare provider. The supplied lyophilized powder must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration. The infusion solution should be prepared and administered by a trained medical professional using aseptic technique by the following procedure: Calculate the dose, total volume of reconstituted REMICADE solution required and the number of REMICADE vials needed. More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Reconstitute each 100 mg REMICADE vial with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to obtain a concentration of 10 mg/mL, using a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge or smaller needle as follows: Remove the flip-top from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through the center of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to the glass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The reconstituted solution should be colorless to light yellow and opalescent, and the solution may develop a few translucent particles as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if the lyophilized powder has not fully dissolved or if opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particles are present. Do not store unused reconstituted REMICADE solution. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted REMICADE solution to 250 mL For volumes greater than 250 mL, either use a larger infusion bag (e.g. 500 mL) or multiple 250 mL infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion solution does not exceed 4 mg/mL. with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, (do not dilute with any other diluent) as follows: Withdraw a volume from the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 250 mL bottle or bag equal to the total volume of reconstituted REMICADE required for a dose. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted REMICADE solution from the vial(s) to the 250 mL infusion bottle or bag. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted REMICADE solution remaining in the vial(s). Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The resulting infusion concentration should range between 0.4 mg/mL (minimum recommended concentration) and 4 mg/mL (maximum recommended concentration) of infliximab. The REMICADE infusion should begin within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. The infusion must be administered intravenously for at least 2 hours with an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore size of 1.2 µm or less). Given that the vials do not contain antibacterial preservatives, discard any unused portion of the infusion solution (do not store for reuse). No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-administration of REMICADE with other agents. REMICADE should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning • Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis) and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. ( 5.1 ) • Discontinue INFLECTRA if a patient develops a serious infection. • Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting INFLECTRA. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. ( 5.1 ) • Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including infliximab products. ( 5.2 ) • Postmarketing cases of fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including infliximab products. Almost all had received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of cases were reported in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, most of whom were adolescent or young adult males. ( 5.2 ) SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with infliximab products are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. INFLECTRA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: • Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before INFLECTRA use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to INFLECTRA use. • Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. • Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. The risks and benefits of treatment with INFLECTRA should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with INFLECTRA, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including infliximab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>10%) – infections (e.g. upper respiratory, sinusitis, and pharyngitis), infusion-related reactions, headache, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact CELLTRION, Inc. at 1-800-383-7504 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Adults The data described herein reflect exposure to infliximab in 4779 adult patients (1304 patients with RA, 1106 patients with CD, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 484 with UC, 1373 with Ps, and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2625 patients exposed beyond 30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1 year. [ For information on adverse reactions in pediatric patients see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . One of the most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (e.g., dyspnea, flushing, headache and rash). Infusion-Related Reactions Adverse Reactions During or Shortly After Infusion An infusion reaction was defined in clinical trials as any adverse event occurring during an infusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In all the clinical studies, approximately 20% of infliximab-treated patients experienced an infusion reaction compared with 10% of placebo-treated patients. Of infliximab-treated patients who had an infusion reaction during the induction period, 27% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Of patients who did not have an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Among all infliximab infusions, 3% were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as fever or chills, 1% were accompanied by cardiopulmonary reactions (primarily chest pain, hypotension, hypertension or dyspnea), and <1% were accompanied by pruritus, urticaria, or the combined symptoms of pruritus/urticaria and cardiopulmonary reactions. Serious infusion reactions occurred in <1% of patients and included anaphylaxis, convulsions, erythematous rash and hypotension. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued treatment with infliximab because of infusion reactions, and all patients recovered with treatment and/or discontinuation of the infusion. Infliximab infusions beyond the initial infusion were not associated with a higher incidence of reactions. The infusion reaction rates remained stable in Ps through 1 year in Ps Study I. In psoriasis Study II, the rates were variable over time and somewhat higher following the final infusion than after the initial infusion. Across the 3 Ps studies, the percent of total infusions resulting in infusion reactions (i.e., an adverse event occurring within 1 hour) was 7% in the 3 mg/kg group, 4% in the 5 mg/kg group, and 1% in the placebo group. Patients who became positive for antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately two to three-fold) to have an infusion reaction than were those who were negative. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to reduce the frequency of both antibodies to infliximab and infusion reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Infusion Reactions Following Re-administration In a clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe Ps designed to assess the efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of infliximab following disease flare, 4% (8/219) of patients in the re-treatment induction therapy arm experienced serious infusion reactions versus <1% (1/222) in the maintenance therapy arm. Patients enrolled in this trial did not receive any concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In this study, the majority of serious infusion reactions occurred during the second infusion at Week 2. Symptoms included, but were not limited to, dyspnea, urticaria, facial edema, and hypotension. In all cases, treatment with infliximab was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Delayed Reactions/Reactions Following Re-administration In Ps studies, approximately 1% of patients treated with infliximab experienced a possible delayed hypersensitivity reaction, generally reported as serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever and/or rash. These reactions generally occurred within 2 weeks after repeat infusion. Infections In infliximab clinical studies, treated infections were reported in 36% of patients treated with infliximab (average of 51 weeks of follow-up) and in 25% of placebo-treated patients (average of 37 weeks of follow-up). The infections most frequently reported were respiratory tract infections (including sinusitis, pharyngitis, and bronchitis) and urinary tract infections. Among patients treated with infliximab, serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, skin ulceration, sepsis, and bacterial infection. In clinical trials, 7 opportunistic infections were reported; 2 cases each of coccidioidomycosis (1 case was fatal) and histoplasmosis (1 case was fatal), and 1 case each of pneumocystosis, nocardiosis and cytomegalovirus. Tuberculosis (TB) was reported in 14 patients, 4 of whom died due to miliary tuberculosis. Other cases of TB, including disseminated TB, also have been reported postmarketing. Most of these cases of TB occurred within the first 2 months after initiation of therapy with infliximab and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the 1-year placebo-controlled studies RA I and RA II, 5.3% of patients receiving infliximab every 8 weeks with MTX developed serious infections as compared to 3.4% of placebo patients receiving MTX. Of 924 patients receiving infliximab, 1.7% developed pneumonia and 0.4% developed TB, when compared to 0.3% and 0.0% in the placebo arm respectively. In a shorter (22-week) placebo-controlled study of 1082 RA patients randomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg infusions with infliximab at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks with MTX, serious infections were more frequent in the 10 mg/kg infliximab group (5.3%) than the 3 mg/kg or placebo groups (1.7% in both). During the 54-week Crohn's II Study, 15% of patients with fistulizing CD developed a new fistula-related abscess. In clinical studies with infliximab in patients with UC, infections treated with antimicrobials were reported in 27% of patients treated with infliximab (average of 41 weeks of follow-up) and in 18% of placebo-treated patients (average 32 weeks of follow-up). The types of infections, including serious infections, reported in patients with UC were similar to those reported in other clinical studies. The onset of serious infections may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, and fatigue. The majority of serious infections, however, may also be preceded by signs or symptoms localized to the site of the infection. Autoantibodies/Lupus-like Syndrome Approximately half of patients treated with infliximab in clinical trials who were antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative at baseline developed a positive ANA during the trial compared with approximately one-fifth of placebo-treated patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were newly detected in approximately one-fifth of patients treated with infliximab compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. Reports of lupus and lupus-like syndromes, however, remain uncommon. Malignancies In controlled trials, more patients treated with infliximab developed malignancies than placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In a randomized controlled clinical trial exploring the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe COPD who were either current smokers or ex-smokers, 157 patients were treated with infliximab at doses similar to those used in RA and CD. Of these infliximab-treated patients, 9 developed a malignancy, including 1 lymphoma, for a rate of 7.67 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 3.51 – 14.56). There was 1 reported malignancy among 77 control patients for a rate of 1.63 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 0.04 – 9.10). The majority of the malignancies developed in the lung or head and neck [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Adverse Reactions in Patients with NYHA Class III/IV Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind study evaluating infliximab in moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of infliximab at 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg infliximab dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg infliximab group had died compared with 4 deaths each in the 5 mg/kg infliximab and the placebo groups. There were trends toward increased dyspnea, hypotension, angina, and dizziness in both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups, versus placebo. Infliximab products have not been studied in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA Class I/II) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including acute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has occurred in patients receiving TNF blockers, including infliximab products, who are chronic carriers of this virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . In clinical trials in RA, CD, UC, AS, Ps, and PsA, elevations of aminotransferases were observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving infliximab than in controls (Table 1), both when infliximab was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In general, patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of infliximab, or modification of concomitant medications. Table 1 Proportion of Patients with Elevated ALT in Clinical Trials in Adults Proportion of patients with elevated ALT >1 to 3 × ULN ≥3 × ULN ≥5 × ULN Placebo Infliximab Placebo Infliximab Placebo Infliximab Rheumatoid arthritis Placebo patients received methotrexate while patients treated with infliximab received both infliximab and methotrexate. Median follow-up was 58 weeks. 24% 34% 3% 4% <1% <1% Crohn's disease Placebo patients in the 2 Phase 3 trials in CD received an initial dose of 5 mg/kg infliximab at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase. Patients who were randomized to the placebo maintenance group and then later crossed over to infliximab are included in the infliximab group in ALT analysis. Median follow-up was 54 weeks. 34% 39% 4% 5% 0% 2% Ulcerative colitis Median follow-up was 30 weeks. Specifically, the median duration of follow-up was 30 weeks for placebo and 31 weeks for infliximab. 12% 17% 1% 2% <1% <1% Ankylosing spondylitis Median follow-up was 24 weeks for the placebo group and 102 weeks for infliximab group. 15% 51% 0% 10% 0% 4% Psoriatic arthritis Median follow-up was 39 weeks for infliximab group and 18 weeks for the placebo group. 16% 50% 0% 7% 0% 2% Plaque psoriasis ALT values are obtained in 2 Phase 3 Ps studies with median follow-up of 50 weeks for infliximab and 16 weeks for placebo. 24% 49% <1% 8% 0% 3% Adverse Reactions in Psoriasis Studies During the placebo-controlled portion across the 3 clinical trials up to week 16, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined as resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg infliximab group, 1.9% in the placebo group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group. Among patients in the 2 Phase 3 studies, 12.4% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE in Study I. In Study II, 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively, through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE. One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg of infliximab. Serious infections included sepsis, and abscesses. In Study I, 2.7% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. In Study II, 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through 1 year of treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. The most common serious infection (requiring hospitalization) was abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by 5 (0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group. Two active cases of tuberculosis were reported: 6 weeks and 34 weeks after starting infliximab. In the placebo-controlled portion of the Ps studies, 7 of 1123 patients who received infliximab at any dose were diagnosed with at least one NMSC compared to 0 of 334 patients who received placebo. In the Ps studies, 1% (15/1373) of patients experienced serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever, and/or rash, usually early in the treatment course. Of these patients, 6 required hospitalization due to fever, severe myalgia, arthralgia, swollen joints, and immobility. Other Adverse Reactions in Adults Safety data are available from 4779 infliximab-treated adult patients, including 1304 with RA, 1106 with CD, 484 with UC, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 1373 with Ps and 17 with other conditions. [For information on other adverse reactions in pediatric patients, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of all patients with RA receiving 4 or more infusions are in Table 2. The types and frequencies of adverse reactions observed were similar in infliximab-treated RA, AS, PsA, Ps and CD patients except for abdominal pain, which occurred in 26% of infliximab-treated patients with CD. In the CD studies, there were insufficient numbers and duration of follow-up for patients who never received infliximab to provide meaningful comparisons. Table 2 Adverse Reactions that Occurred in ≥ 5% of Patients who Received ≥ 4 Infliximab Infusions for RA Placebo Infliximab (n=350) (n=1129) Average weeks of follow-up 59 weeks 66 weeks Upper respiratory tract infection 25% 32% Nausea 20% 21% Headache 14% 18% Sinusitis 8% 14% Diarrhea 12% 12% Abdominal pain 8% 12% Pharyngitis 8% 12% Coughing 8% 12% Bronchitis 9% 10% Rash 5% 10% Dyspepsia 7% 10% Fatigue 7% 9% Urinary tract infection 6% 8% Pain 7% 8% Arthralgia 7% 8% Pruritus 2% 7% Fever 4% 7% Hypertension 5% 7% Moniliasis 3% 5% The most common serious adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Other serious, medically relevant adverse reactions ≥0.2% or clinically significant adverse reactions by body system were as follows: • Body as a whole: allergic reaction, edema • Blood: pancytopenia • Cardiovascular: hypotension • Gastrointestinal: constipation, intestinal obstruction • Central and Peripheral Nervous: dizziness • Heart Rate and Rhythm: bradycardia • Liver and Biliary: hepatitis • Metabolic and Nutritional: dehydration • Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting: thrombocytopenia • Neoplasms: lymphoma • Red Blood Cell: anemia, hemolytic anemia • Resistance Mechanism: cellulitis, sepsis, serum sickness, sarcoidosis • Respiratory: lower respiratory tract infection (including pneumonia), pleurisy, pulmonary edema • Skin and Appendages: increased sweating • Vascular (Extracardiac): thrombophlebitis • White Cell and Reticuloendothelial: leukopenia, lymphadenopathy Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease There were some differences in the adverse reactions observed in the pediatric patients receiving infliximab compared to those observed in adults with CD. These differences are discussed in the following paragraphs. The following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in 103 randomized pediatric CD patients administered 5 mg/kg infliximab through 54 weeks than in 385 adult CD patients receiving a similar treatment regimen: anemia (11%), leukopenia (9%), flushing (9%), viral infection (8%), neutropenia (7%), bone fracture (7%), bacterial infection (6%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (6%). Infections were reported in 56% of randomized pediatric patients in Study Peds Crohn's and in 50% of adult patients in Study Crohn's I. In Study Peds Crohn's, infections were reported more frequently for patients who received every 8-week as opposed to every 12-week infusions (74% and 38%, respectively), while serious infections were reported for 3 patients in the every 8-week and 4 patients in the every 12-week maintenance treatment group. The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious infection was abscess. Pneumonia was reported for 3 patients, (2 in the every 8- week and 1 in the every 12-week maintenance treatment groups). Herpes zoster was reported for 2 patients in the every 8-week maintenance treatment group. In Study Peds Crohn's, 18% of randomized patients experienced 1 or more infusion reactions, with no notable difference between treatment groups. Of the 112 patients in Study Peds Crohn's, there were no serious infusion reactions, and 2 patients had non-serious anaphylactoid reactions. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 18% of pediatric patients in CD clinical trials; 4% had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 1% had elevations ≥5 × ULN. (Median follow-up was 53 weeks). Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Overall, the adverse reactions reported in the pediatric UC trial and adult UC (Study UC I and Study UC II) studies were generally consistent. In a pediatric UC trial, the most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, fever, and headache. Infections were reported in 31 (52%) of 60 treated patients in the pediatric UC trial and 22 (37%) required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with infections in the pediatric UC trial was similar to that in the pediatric CD study (Study Peds Crohn's) but higher than the proportion in the adults' UC studies (Study UC I and Study UC II). The overall incidence of infections in the pediatric UC trial was 13/22 (59%) in the every 8 week maintenance treatment group. Upper respiratory tract infection (7/60 [12%]) and pharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently reported respiratory system infections. Serious infections were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 17% (10/60) of pediatric patients in the pediatric UC trial; 7% (4/60) had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 2% (1/60) had elevations ≥5 × ULN (median follow-up was 49 weeks). Overall, 8 of 60 (13%) treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions, including 4 of 22 (18%) patients in the every 8-week treatment maintenance group. No serious infusion reactions were reported. In the pediatric UC trial, 45 patients were in the 12 to 17 year age group and 15 in the 6 to 11 year age group. The numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to make any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events. There were higher proportions of patients with serious adverse events (40% vs. 18%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (40% vs. 16%) in the younger age group than in the older age group. While the proportion of patients with infections was also higher in the younger age group (60% vs. 49%), for serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two age groups (13% in the 6 to 11 year age group vs. 11% in the 12 to 17 year age group). Overall proportions of adverse reactions, including infusion reactions, were similar between the 6 to 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups (13%). 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other infliximab products may be misleading. Treatment with infliximab products can be associated with the development of antibodies to infliximab products. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method was originally used to measure anti-infliximab antibodies in clinical studies of infliximab. The EIA method is subject to interference by serum infliximab, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the rate of patient antibody formation. A separate, drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method for detecting antibodies to infliximab was subsequently developed and validated. This method is 60-fold more sensitive than the original EIA. With the ECLIA method, all clinical samples can be classified as either positive or negative for antibodies to infliximab without the need for the inconclusive category. The incidence of antibodies to infliximab was based on the original EIA method in all clinical studies of infliximab except for the Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with UC where the incidence of antibodies to infliximab was detected using both the EIA and ECLIA methods. Immunogenicity in Adult Patients The incidence of antibodies to infliximab in patients with RA and CD given a 3-dose induction regimen followed by maintenance dosing was approximately 10% as assessed through 1 to 2 years of infliximab treatment. A higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab was observed in CD patients receiving infliximab after drug-free intervals >16 weeks. In a PsA study in which 191 patients received 5 mg/kg with or without MTX, antibodies to infliximab occurred in 15% of patients. The majority of antibody-positive patients had low titers. Antibody development was lower among RA and CD patients receiving immunosuppressant therapies such as 6-MP/AZA or MTX. Patients who were antibody-positive were more likely to have higher rates of clearance, have reduced efficacy, and to experience an infusion reaction than were patients who were antibody negative [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In the Ps Study II, which included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 36% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year, and in 51% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year. In the Ps Study III, which also included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 20% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (weeks 0, 2 and 6), and in 27% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg induction. Despite the increase in antibody formation, the infusion reaction rates in Studies I and II in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction followed by every 8 week maintenance for 1 year and in Study III in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (14.1% – 23.0%) and serious infusion reaction rates (<1%) were similar to those observed in other study populations. The clinical significance of apparent increased immunogenicity on efficacy and infusion reactions in Ps patients as compared to patients with other diseases treated with infliximab products over the long term is not known. Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease In Study Peds Crohn's, in which all patients received stable doses of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, excluding inconclusive samples, 3 of 24 patients had antibodies to infliximab. Although 105 patients were tested for antibodies to infliximab, 81 patients were classified as inconclusive because they could not be ruled as negative due to assay interference by the presence of infliximab in the sample. Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis In the pediatric UC trial, 58 patients were evaluated for antibodies to infliximab using the EIA as well as the drug-tolerant ECLIA. With the EIA, 4 of 58 (7%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. With the ECLIA, 30 of 58 (52%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. The higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab by the ECLIA method was due to the 60-fold higher sensitivity compared to the EIA method. While EIA-positive patients generally had undetectable trough infliximab concentrations, ECLIA-positive patients could have detectable trough concentrations of infliximab because the ECLIA assay is more sensitive and drug-tolerant. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions, some with fatal outcomes, have been identified during post approval use of infliximab products in adult and pediatric patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing Adverse Reactions in Adults and Pediatric Patients • Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , agranulocytosis (including infants exposed in utero to infliximab products), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. • Interstitial lung disease (including pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial pneumonitis and rapidly progressive disease). • Pericardial effusion, systemic and cutaneous vasculitis. • Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), worsening psoriasis (all subtypes including pustular, primarily palmoplantar), lichenoid reactions. • Peripheral demyelinating disorders (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy) transverse myelitis, and neuropathies (additional neurologic reactions have also been observed) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. • Acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] and vaccine breakthrough infection including bovine tuberculosis (disseminated BCG infection) following vaccination in an infant exposed in utero to infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . • Malignancies, including leukemia, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema and severe bronchospasm, and seizure have been associated with administration of infliximab products. • Transient visual loss have been reported in association with infliximab products during or within 2 hours of infusion. Cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial ischemia/infarction (some fatal), and arrhythmia occurring within 24 hours of initiation of infusion have also been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . • New onset immune disorders (e.g., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease). Postmarketing Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients The following serious adverse reactions have been reported in the postmarketing experience in pediatric patients: infections (some fatal) including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, infusion reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, malignancies, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , transient hepatic enzyme abnormalities, lupus-like syndromes, and the development of autoantibodies."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity) that occur during infusion and shortly after infusion ( 2.11 ) INFLECTRA is administered by intravenous infusion for at least 2 hours with an in-line filter ( 2.11 ) Crohn's Disease ( 2.1 ) • 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Some adult patients who initially respond to treatment may benefit from increasing the dose to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks if they later lose their response. Pediatric Crohn's Disease (≥ 6 years old) ( 2.2 ) • 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Ulcerative Colitis ( 2.3 ) • 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis (≥ 6 years old) ( 2.4 ) • 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Rheumatoid Arthritis ( 2.5 ) • In conjunction with methotrexate, 3 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Some patients may benefit from increasing the dose up to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks or treating as often as every 4 weeks. Ankylosing Spondylitis ( 2.6 ) • 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 6 weeks. Psoriatic Arthritis ( 2.7 ) and Plaque Psoriasis ( 2.8 ) • 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. 2.1 Dosage in Adult Crohn's Disease The recommended dosage of INFLECTRA is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active CD or fistulizing CD. For adult patients who respond and then lose their response, consideration may be given to treatment with 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Patients who do not respond by Week 14 are unlikely to respond with continued dosing and consideration should be given to discontinue INFLECTRA in these patients. 2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Crohn's Disease The recommended dosage of INFLECTRA for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active CD is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. 2.3 Dosage in Adult Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dosage of INFLECTRA is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. 2.4 Dosage in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dosage of INFLECTRA for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active UC is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. 2.5 Dosage in Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage of INFLECTRA is 3 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. INFLECTRA should be given in combination with methotrexate. For patients who have an incomplete response, consideration may be given to adjusting the dosage up to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks or treating as often as every 4 weeks bearing in mind that risk of serious infections is increased at higher doses per infusion or more frequent dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.6 Dosage in Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosage of INFLECTRA is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks thereafter for the treatment of active AS. 2.7 Dosage in Psoriatic Arthritis The recommended dosage of INFLECTRA is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of PsA. INFLECTRA can be used with or without methotrexate. 2.8 Dosage in Plaque Psoriasis The recommended dosage of INFLECTRA in adult patients is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of chronic severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling) Ps. 2.9 Assessment for Latent and Active Tuberculosis Prior to initiating INFLECTRA and periodically during therapy, patients should be evaluated for active tuberculosis and tested for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.10 Administration Instructions Regarding Infusion Reactions Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, other reactions) that occur during infusion and shortly after infusion. Prior to infusion with INFLECTRA, patient may be premedicated with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . For mild to moderate reactions during the infusion, consider slowing or stopping the infusion. Upon resolution of these reactions, may reinitiate at a lower infusion rate and/or with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids. Discontinue the infusion if the mild to moderate reactions reoccur. Discontinue the infusion if severe hypersensitivity reactions occur during the infusion. 2.11 Reconstitution, Dilution, and Administration Instructions INFLECTRA is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare provider. The supplied lyophilized powder must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration. The infusion solution should be prepared and administered by a trained medical professional using aseptic technique by the following procedure: 1. Calculate the dose, total volume of reconstituted INFLECTRA solution required and the number of INFLECTRA vials needed. More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. 2. Reconstitute each 100 mg INFLECTRA vial with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to obtain a concentration of 10 mg/mL, using a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge or smaller needle as follows: • Remove the flip-top from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. • Insert the syringe needle into the vial through the center of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to the glass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. • Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The reconstituted solution should be colorless to light yellow and opalescent, and the solution may develop a few translucent particles as infliximab-dyyb is a protein. Do not use if the lyophilized powder has not fully dissolved or if opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particles are present. Do not store unused reconstituted INFLECTRA solution. 3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted INFLECTRA solution to 250 mL For volumes greater than 250 mL, either use a larger infusion bag (e.g. 500 mL) or multiple 250 mL infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion solution does not exceed 4 mg/mL. with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, (do not dilute with any other diluent) as follows: • Withdraw a volume from the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 250 mL bottle or bag equal to the total volume of reconstituted INFLECTRA required for a dose. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted INFLECTRA solution from the vial(s) to the 250 mL infusion bottle or bag. • Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted INFLECTRA solution remaining in the vial(s). • Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The resulting infusion concentration should range between 0.4 mg/mL (minimum recommended concentration) and 4 mg/mL (maximum recommended concentration) of infliximab-dyyb. 4. The INFLECTRA infusion should begin within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. The infusion must be administered intravenously for at least 2 hours with an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore size of 1.2 µm or less). 5. Given that the vials do not contain antibacterial preservatives, discard any unused portion of the infusion solution (do not store for reuse). No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-administration of INFLECTRA with other agents. INFLECTRA should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis) and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. ( 5.1 ) Discontinue RENFLEXIS if a patient develops a serious infection. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting RENFLEXIS. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. ( 5.1 ) Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including infliximab products. ( 5.2 ) Postmarketing cases of fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including infliximab products. Almost all had received azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of cases were reported in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, most of whom were adolescent or young adult males. ( 5.2 ) SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with infliximab products are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. RENFLEXIS should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before RENFLEXIS use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to RENFLEXIS use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. The risks and benefits of treatment with RENFLEXIS should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with RENFLEXIS, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including infliximab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males."

Adverse Reactions in Adults The data described herein reflect exposure to infliximab in 4779 adult patients (1304 patients with RA, 1106 patients with CD, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 484 with UC, 1373 with Ps, and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2625 patients exposed beyond 30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1 year. [For information on adverse reactions in pediatric patients see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. One of the most-common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (e.g., dyspnea, flushing, headache and rash). Infusion-Related Reactions Adverse Reactions During or Shortly After Infusion An infusion reaction was defined in clinical trials as any adverse event occurring during an infusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In all the clinical studies, approximately 20% of infliximab-treated patients experienced an infusion reaction compared with 10% of placebo-treated patients. Of infliximab-treated patients who had an infusion reaction during the induction period, 27% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Of patients who did not have an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Among all infliximab infusions, 3% were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as fever or chills, 1% were accompanied by cardiopulmonary reactions (primarily chest pain, hypotension, hypertension or dyspnea), and <1% were accompanied by pruritus, urticaria, or the combined symptoms of pruritus/urticaria and cardiopulmonary reactions. Serious infusion reactions occurred in <1% of patients and included anaphylaxis, convulsions, erythematous rash and hypotension. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued infliximab because of infusion reactions, and all patients recovered with treatment and/or discontinuation of the infusion. Infliximab infusions beyond the initial infusion were not associated with a higher incidence of reactions. The infusion reaction rates remained stable in Ps through 1 year in Ps Study I. In psoriasis Study II, the rates were variable over time and somewhat higher following the final infusion than after the initial infusion. Across the 3 Ps studies, the percent of total infusions resulting in infusion reactions (i.e., an adverse event occurring within 1 hour) was 7% in the 3 mg/kg group, 4% in the 5 mg/kg group, and 1% in the placebo group. Patients who became positive for antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately two- to three-fold) to have an infusion reaction than were those who were negative. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to reduce the frequency of both antibodies to infliximab and infusion reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Infusion Reactions Following Re-administration In a clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe Ps designed to assess the efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of infliximab following disease flare, 4% (8/219) of patients in the re-treatment induction therapy arm experienced serious infusion reactions versus < 1% (1/222) in the maintenance therapy arm. Patients enrolled in this trial did not receive any concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In this study, the majority of serious infusion reactions occurred during the second infusion at Week 2. Symptoms included, but were not limited to, dyspnea, urticaria, facial edema, and hypotension. In all cases, infliximab treatment was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Delayed Reactions/Reactions Following Re-administration In Ps studies, approximately 1% of infliximab-treated patients experienced a possible delayed hypersensitivity reaction, generally reported as serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever and/or rash. These reactions generally occurred within 2 weeks after repeat infusion. Infections In infliximab clinical studies, treated infections were reported in 36% of infliximab-treated patients (average of 51 weeks of follow-up) and in 25% of placebo-treated patients (average of 37 weeks of follow-up). The infections most frequently reported were respiratory tract infections (including sinusitis, pharyngitis, and bronchitis) and urinary tract infections. Among infliximab-treated patients, serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, skin ulceration, sepsis, and bacterial infection. In clinical trials, 7 opportunistic infections were reported; 2 cases each of coccidioidomycosis (1 case was fatal) and histoplasmosis (1 case was fatal), and 1 case each of pneumocystosis, nocardiosis and cytomegalovirus. Tuberculosis (TB) was reported in 14 patients, 4 of whom died due to miliary tuberculosis. Other cases of TB, including disseminated TB, also have been reported post-marketing. Most of these cases of TB occurred within the first 2 months after initiation of therapy with infliximab and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the 1-year placebo-controlled studies RA I and RA II, 5.3% of patients receiving infliximab every 8 weeks with MTX developed serious infections as compared to 3.4% of placebo patients receiving MTX. Of 924 patients receiving infliximab, 1.7% developed pneumonia and 0.4% developed TB, when compared to 0.3% and 0.0% in the placebo arm respectively. In a shorter (22-week) placebo-controlled study of 1082 RA patients randomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg infliximab infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks with MTX, serious infections were more frequent in the 10 mg/kg infliximab group (5.3%) than the 3 mg/kg or placebo groups (1.7% in both). During the 54-week Crohn's II Study, 15% of patients with fistulizing CD developed a new fistula-related abscess. In infliximab clinical studies in patients with UC, infections treated with antimicrobials were reported in 27% of infliximab-treated patients (average of 41 weeks of follow-up) and in 18% of placebo-treated patients (average 32 weeks of follow-up). The types of infections, including serious infections, reported in patients with UC were similar to those reported in other clinical studies. The onset of serious infections may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, and fatigue. The majority of serious infections, however, may also be preceded by signs or symptoms localized to the site of the infection. Autoantibodies/Lupus-like Syndrome Approximately half of infliximab-treated patients in clinical trials who were antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative at baseline developed a positive ANA during the trial compared with approximately one-fifth of placebo-treated patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were newly detected in approximately one-fifth of infliximab-treated patients compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. Reports of lupus and lupus-like syndromes, however, remain uncommon. Malignancies In controlled trials, more infliximab-treated patients developed malignancies than placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In a randomized controlled clinical trial exploring the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe COPD who were either current smokers or ex-smokers, 157 patients were treated with infliximab at doses similar to those used in RA and CD. Of these infliximab-treated patients, 9 developed a malignancy, including 1 lymphoma, for a rate of 7.67 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 3.51-14.56). There was 1 reported malignancy among 77 control patients for a rate of 1.63 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 0.04-9.10). The majority of the malignancies developed in the lung or head and neck [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Adverse Reactions in Patients with NYHA Class III/IV Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind study evaluating infliximab in moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of infliximab 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg infliximab dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg infliximab group had died compared with 4 deaths each in the 5 mg/kg infliximab and the placebo groups. There were trends toward increased dyspnea, hypotension, angina, and dizziness in both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups, versus placebo. Infliximab products have not been studied in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA Class I/II) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including acute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has occurred in patients receiving TNF blockers, including infliximab products, who are chronic carriers of this virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . In clinical trials in RA, CD, UC, AS, Ps, and PsA, elevations of aminotransferases were observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving infliximab than in controls (Table 1), both when infliximab was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In general, patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of infliximab, or modification of concomitant medications. Table 1 Proportion of Patients with Elevated ALT in Clinical Trials in Adults Proportion of patients with elevated ALT > 1 to < 3 × ULN ≥ 3 × ULN ≥ 5 × ULN Placebo Infliximab Placebo Infliximab Placebo Infliximab Rheumatoid arthritis Placebo patients received methotrexate while infliximab patients received both infliximab and methotrexate. Median follow-up was 58 weeks. 24% 34% 3% 4% < 1% < 1% Crohn's disease Placebo patients in the 2 Phase 3 trials in CD received an initial dose of 5 mg/kg infliximab at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase. Patients who were randomized to the placebo maintenance group and then later crossed over to infliximab are included in the infliximab group in ALT analysis. Median follow-up was 54 weeks. 34% 39% 4% 5% 0% 2% Ulcerative colitis Median follow-up was 30 weeks. Specifically, the median duration of follow-up was 30 weeks for placebo and 31 weeks for infliximab. 12% 17% 1% 2% < 1% < 1% Ankylosing spondylitis Median follow-up was 24 weeks for the placebo group and 102 weeks for the infliximab group. 15% 51% 0% 10% 0% 4% Psoriatic arthritis Median follow-up was 39 weeks for the infliximab group and 18 weeks for the placebo group. 16% 50% 0% 7% 0% 2% Plaque psoriasis ALT values are obtained in 2 Phase 3 Ps studies with median follow-up of 50 weeks for infliximab and 16 weeks for placebo. 24% 49% <1% 8% 0% 3% Adverse Reactions in Psoriasis Studies During the placebo-controlled portion across the 3 clinical trials up to Week 16, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined as resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg infliximab group, 1.9% in the placebo group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group. Among patients in the 2 Phase 3 studies, 12.4% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE in Study I. In Study II, 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively, through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE. One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg infliximab. Serious infections included sepsis, and abscesses. In Study I, 2.7% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. In Study II, 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through 1 year of treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. The most common serious infection (requiring hospitalization) was abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by 5 (0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group. Two active cases of tuberculosis were reported: 6 weeks and 34 weeks after starting infliximab. In the placebo-controlled portion of the Ps studies, 7 of 1123 patients who received infliximab at any dose were diagnosed with at least one NMSC compared to 0 of 334 patients who received placebo. In the Ps studies, 1% (15/1373) of patients experienced serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever, and/or rash, usually early in the treatment course. Of these patients, 6 required hospitalization due to fever, severe myalgia, arthralgia, swollen joints, and immobility. Other Adverse Reactions in Adults Safety data are available from 4779 adult patients treated with infliximab, including 1304 with RA, 1106 with CD, 484 with UC, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 1373 with Ps and 17 with other conditions. [For information on other adverse reactions in pediatric patients, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 5% of all patients with RA receiving 4 or more infusions are in Table 2. The types and frequencies of adverse reactions observed were similar in RA, AS, PsA, Ps, and CD patients treated with infliximab except for abdominal pain, which occurred in 26% of infliximab-treated patients with CD. In the CD studies, there were insufficient numbers and duration of follow-up for patients who never received infliximab to provide meaningful comparisons. Table 2 Adverse Reactions that Occurred in ≥ 5% of Patients who Received ≥ 4 Infliximab Infusions for RA Placebo Infliximab (n = 350) (n = 1129) Average weeks of follow-up 59 weeks 66 weeks Upper respiratory tract infection 25% 32% Nausea 20% 21% Headache 14% 18% Sinusitis 8% 14% Diarrhea 12% 12% Abdominal pain 8% 12% Pharyngitis 8% 12% Coughing 8% 12% Bronchitis 9% 10% Rash 5% 10% Dyspepsia 7% 10% Fatigue 7% 9% Urinary tract infection 6% 8% Pain 7% 8% Arthralgia 7% 8% Pruritus 2% 7% Fever 4% 7% Hypertension 5% 7% Moniliasis 3% 5% The most common serious adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Other serious, medically relevant adverse reactions ≥ 0.2% or clinically significant adverse reactions by body system were as follows: Body as a whole: allergic reaction, edema Blood: pancytopenia Cardiovascular: hypotension Gastrointestinal: constipation, intestinal obstruction Central and Peripheral Nervous: dizziness Heart Rate and Rhythm: bradycardia Liver and Biliary: hepatitis Metabolic and Nutritional: dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting: thrombocytopenia Neoplasms: lymphoma Red Blood Cell: anemia, hemolytic anemia Resistance Mechanism: cellulitis, sepsis, serum sickness, sarcoidosis Respiratory: lower respiratory tract infection (including pneumonia), pleurisy, pulmonary edema Skin and Appendages: increased sweating Vascular (Extracardiac): thrombophlebitis White Cell and Reticuloendothelial: leukopenia, lymphadenopathy Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease There were some differences in the adverse reactions observed in the pediatric patients receiving infliximab compared to those observed in adults with CD. These differences are discussed in the following paragraphs. The following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in 103 randomized pediatric CD patients administered 5 mg/kg infliximab through 54 weeks than in 385 adult CD patients receiving a similar treatment regimen: anemia (11%), leukopenia (9%), flushing (9%), viral infection (8%), neutropenia (7%), bone fracture (7%), bacterial infection (6%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (6%). Infections were reported in 56% of randomized pediatric patients in Study Peds Crohn's and in 50% of adult patients in Study Crohn's I. In Study Peds Crohn's, infections were reported more frequently for patients who received every 8-week as opposed to every 12-week infusions (74% and 38%, respectively), while serious infections were reported for 3 patients in the every 8-week and 4 patients in the every 12-week maintenance treatment group. The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious infection was abscess. Pneumonia was reported for 3 patients, (2 in the every 8-week and 1 in the every 12-week maintenance treatment groups). Herpes zoster was reported for 2 patients in the every 8-week maintenance treatment group. In Study Peds Crohn's, 18% of randomized patients experienced 1 or more infusion reactions, with no notable difference between treatment groups. Of the 112 patients in Study Peds Crohn's, there were no serious infusion reactions, and 2 patients had non-serious anaphylactoid reactions. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 18% of pediatric patients in CD clinical trials; 4% had ALT elevations ≥ 3 × ULN, and 1% had elevations ≥ 5 × ULN. (Median follow-up was 53 weeks). Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Overall, the adverse reactions reported in the pediatric UC trial and adult UC (Study UC I and Study UC II) studies were generally consistent. In a pediatric UC trial, the most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, fever, and headache. Infections were reported in 31 (52%) of 60 treated patients in the pediatric UC trial and 22 (37%) required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with infections in the pediatric UC trial was similar to that in the pediatric CD study (Study Peds Crohn's) but higher than the proportion in the adults' UC studies (Study UC I and Study UC II). The overall incidence of infections in the pediatric UC trial was 13/22 (59%) in the every 8 week maintenance treatment group. Upper respiratory tract infection (7/60 [12%]) and pharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently reported respiratory system infections. Serious infections were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 17% (10/60) of pediatric patients in the pediatric UC trial; 7% (4/60) had ALT elevations ≥ 3 × ULN, and 2% (1/60) had elevations ≥ 5 × ULN (median follow-up was 49 weeks). Overall, 8 of 60 (13%) treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions, including 4 of 22 (18%) patients in the every 8-week treatment maintenance group. No serious infusion reactions were reported. In the pediatric UC trial, 45 patients were in the 12 to 17 year age group and 15 in the 6 to 11 year age group. The numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to make any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events. There were higher proportions of patients with serious adverse events (40% vs. 18%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (40% vs. 16%) in the younger age group than in the older age group. While the proportion of patients with infections was also higher in the younger age group (60% vs. 49%), for serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two age groups (13% in the 6 to 11 year age group vs. 11% in the 12 to 17 year age group). Overall proportions of adverse reactions, including infusion reactions, were similar between the 6 to 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups (13%). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of infliximab or of other infliximab products. Treatment with infliximab products can be associated with the development of antibodies to infliximab products. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method was originally used to measure anti-infliximab antibodies in clinical studies of infliximab. The EIA method is subject to interference by serum infliximab, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the rate of patient antibody formation. A separate, drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method for detecting antibodies to infliximab was subsequently developed and validated. This method is 60-fold more sensitive than the original EIA. With the ECLIA method, all clinical samples can be classified as either positive or negative for antibodies to infliximab without the need for the inconclusive category. The incidence of antibodies to infliximab was based on the original EIA method in all clinical studies of infliximab except for the Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with UC where the incidence of antibodies to infliximab was detected using both the EIA and ECLIA methods. Immunogenicity in Adult Patients The incidence of antibodies to infliximab in patients with RA and CD given a 3-dose induction regimen followed by maintenance dosing was approximately 10% as assessed through 1 to 2 years of infliximab treatment. A higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab was observed in CD patients receiving infliximab after drug-free intervals >16 weeks. In a PsA study in which 191 patients received 5 mg/kg with or without MTX, antibodies to infliximab occurred in 15% of patients. The majority of antibody-positive patients had low titers. Antibody development was lower among RA and CD patients receiving immunosuppressant therapies such as 6-MP/AZA or MTX. Patients who were antibody-positive were more likely to have higher rates of clearance, have reduced efficacy, and to experience an infusion reaction than were patients who were antibody negative [see Adverse Reactions 6.1 ] . In the Ps Study II, which included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 36% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year, and in 51% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year. In the Ps Study III, which also included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 20% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (weeks 0, 2 and 6), and in 27% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg induction. Despite the increase in antibody formation, the infusion reaction rates in Studies I and II in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction followed by every 8 week maintenance for 1 year and in Study III in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (14.1%-23.0%) and serious infusion reaction rates (<1%) were similar to those observed in other study populations. The clinical significance of apparent increased immunogenicity on efficacy and infusion reactions in Ps patients as compared to patients with other diseases treated with infliximab products over the long term is not known. Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease In Study Peds Crohn's, in which all patients received stable doses of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, excluding inconclusive samples, 3 of 24 patients had antibodies to infliximab. Although 105 patients were tested for antibodies to infliximab, 81 patients were classified as inconclusive because they could not be ruled as negative due to assay interference by the presence of infliximab in the sample. Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis In the pediatric UC trial, 58 patients were evaluated for antibodies to infliximab using the EIA as well as the drug-tolerant ECLIA. With the EIA, 4 of 58 (7%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. With the ECLIA, 30 of 58 (52%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. The higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab by the ECLIA method was due to the 60-fold higher sensitivity compared to the EIA method. While EIA-positive patients generally had undetectable trough concentration of infliximab, ECLIA-positive patients could have detectable trough concentrations of infliximab because the ECLIA assay is more sensitive and drug-tolerant. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions, some with fatal outcomes, have been identified during post approval use of infliximab products in adult and pediatric patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing Adverse Reactions in Adults and Pediatric Patients Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , agranulocytosis (including infants exposed in utero to infliximab products), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Interstitial lung disease (including pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial pneumonitis and rapidly progressive disease). Pericardial effusion, systemic and cutaneous vasculitis. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), worsening psoriasis (all subtypes including pustular, primarily palmoplantar), lichenoid reactions. Peripheral demyelinating disorders (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy), transverse myelitis, and neuropathies (additional neurologic reactions have also been observed) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] and vaccine breakthrough infection including bovine tuberculosis (disseminated BCG infection) following vaccination in an infant exposed in utero to infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . Malignancies, including leukemia, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema and severe bronchospasm, and seizure have been associated with administration of infliximab products. Transient visual loss have been reported in association with infliximab products during or within 2 hours of infusion. Cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial ischemia/infarction (some fatal), and arrhythmia occurring within 24 hours of initiation of infusion have also been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . New onset immune disorders (e.g., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease). Postmarketing Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients The following serious adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience in pediatric patients: infections (some fatal) including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, infusion reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, malignancies, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , transient hepatic enzyme abnormalities, lupus-like syndromes, and the development of autoantibodies."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity) that occur during infusion and shortly after infusion. ( 2.10 ) RENFLEXIS is administered by intravenous infusion for at least 2 hours with an in-line filter. ( 2.11 ) Crohn's Disease: 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Some adult patients who initially respond to treatment may benefit from increasing the dose to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks if they later lose their response. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric Crohn's Disease (≥ 6 years old): 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.2 ) Ulcerative Colitis: 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.3 ) Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis (≥ 6 years old): 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.4 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis: In conjunction with methotrexate, 3 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Some patients may benefit from increasing the dose up to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks or treating as often as every 4 weeks. ( 2.5 ) Ankylosing Spondylitis: 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 6 weeks. ( 2.6 ) Psoriatic Arthritis and Plaque Psoriasis: 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.7 , 2.8 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Crohn's Disease The recommended dosage of RENFLEXIS is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active CD or fistulizing CD. For adult patients who respond and then lose their response, consideration may be given to treatment with 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Patients who do not respond by Week 14 are unlikely to respond with continued dosing and consideration should be given to discontinue RENFLEXIS in these patients. 2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Crohn's Disease The recommended dosage of RENFLEXIS for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active CD is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. 2.3 Dosage in Adult Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dosage of RENFLEXIS is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. 2.4 Dosage in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dosage of RENFLEXIS for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active UC is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. 2.5 Dosage in Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage of RENFLEXIS is 3 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. RENFLEXIS should be given in combination with methotrexate. For patients who have an incomplete response, consideration may be given to adjusting the dosage up to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks or treating as often as every 4 weeks bearing in mind that risk of serious infections is increased at higher doses per infusion or more frequent dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.6 Dosage in Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosage of RENFLEXIS is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks thereafter for the treatment of active AS. 2.7 Dosage in Psoriatic Arthritis The recommended dosage of RENFLEXIS is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of PsA. RENFLEXIS can be used with or without methotrexate. 2.8 Dosage in Plaque Psoriasis The recommended dosage of RENFLEXIS in adult patients is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of chronic severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling) Ps. 2.9 Assessment for Latent and Active Tuberculosis Prior to initiating RENFLEXIS and periodically during therapy, patients should be evaluated for active tuberculosis and tested for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.10 Administration Instructions Regarding Infusion Reactions Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, other reactions) that occur during infusion and shortly after infusion. Prior to infusion with RENFLEXIS, patients may be premedicated with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . For mild to moderate reactions during the infusion, consider slowing or stopping the infusion. Upon resolution of these reactions, may reinitiate at a lower infusion rate and/or with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids. Discontinue the infusion if the mild to moderate reactions reoccur. Discontinue the infusion if severe hypersensitivity reactions occur during the infusion. 2.11 Reconstitution, Dilution, and Administration Instructions RENFLEXIS is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare provider. The supplied lyophilized powder must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration. The infusion solution should be prepared and administered by a trained medical professional using aseptic technique by the following procedure: Calculate the dose, total volume of reconstituted RENFLEXIS solution required and the number of RENFLEXIS vials needed. More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Reconstitute each 100 mg RENFLEXIS vial with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to obtain a concentration of 10 mg/mL, using a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge or smaller needle as follows: Remove the flip-top from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through the center of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to the glass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The reconstituted solution should be colorless to light yellow and opalescent, and the solution may develop a few translucent particles as infliximab-abda is a protein. Do not use if the lyophilized powder has not fully dissolved or if opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particles are present. Do not store unused reconstituted RENFLEXIS solution. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted RENFLEXIS solution to 250 mL For volumes greater than 250 mL, either use a larger infusion bag (e.g. 500 mL) or multiple 250 mL infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion solution does not exceed 4 mg/mL. with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, (do not dilute with any other diluent) as follows: Withdraw a volume from the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 250 mL bottle or bag equal to the total volume of reconstituted RENFLEXIS required for a dose. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted RENFLEXIS solution from the vial(s) to the 250 mL infusion bottle or bag. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted RENFLEXIS solution remaining in the vial(s). Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The resulting infusion concentration should range between 0.4 mg/mL (minimum recommended concentration) and 4 mg/mL (maximum recommended concentration) of infliximab-abda. The RENFLEXIS infusion should begin within 4 hours of reconstitution and dilution. The infusion must be administered intravenously for at least 2 hours with an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore size of 1.2 μm or less). The diluted RENFLEXIS solution may be stored at room temperature at 25 °C (77°F) for up to 4 hours, including reconstitution and dilution time. If needed, the diluted RENFLEXIS solution may be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 34 days. After removal from refrigeration, the diluted solution may be stored at room temperature at up to 25°C (77°F) for an additional 6 hours. Given that the vials do not contain antibacterial preservatives, discard any unused portion of the infusion solution (do not store for reuse). No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the coadministration of RENFLEXIS with other agents. RENFLEXIS should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents."

    "blackBoxWarnings": [
      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as histoplasmosis) and infections due to other opportunistic pathogens. ( 5.1 ) Discontinue AVSOLA if a patient develops a serious infection. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting AVSOLA. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. ( 5.1 ) Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including infliximab products. ( 5.2 ) Postmarketing cases of fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including infliximab products. Almost all had received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of cases were reported in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, most of whom were adolescent or young adult males. ( 5.2 ) SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with infliximab products are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. AVSOLA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before AVSOLA use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to AVSOLA use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. The risks and benefits of treatment with AVSOLA should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with AVSOLA, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including infliximab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in adolescent and young adult males."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>10%) – infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis, and pharyngitis), infusion-related reactions, headache, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Medical Information at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Adults The data described herein reflect exposure to infliximab in 4779 adult patients (1304 patients with RA, 1106 patients with CD, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 484 with UC, 1373 with Ps, and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2625 patients exposed beyond 30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1-year. [For information on adverse reactions in pediatric patients, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . One of the most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (e.g., dyspnea, flushing, headache and rash). Infusion-Related Reactions Adverse Reactions During or Shortly After Infusion An infusion reaction was defined in clinical trials as any adverse event occurring during an infusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In all the clinical studies, approximately 20% of infliximab-treated patients experienced an infusion reaction compared with 10% of placebo-treated patients. Of infliximab-treated patients who had an infusion reaction during the induction period, 27% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Of patients who did not have an infusion reaction during the induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period. Among all infliximab infusions, 3% were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as fever or chills, 1% were accompanied by cardiopulmonary reactions (primarily chest pain, hypotension, hypertension or dyspnea), and <1% were accompanied by pruritus, urticaria, or the combined symptoms of pruritus/urticaria and cardiopulmonary reactions. Serious infusion reactions occurred in <1% of patients and included anaphylaxis, convulsions, erythematous rash and hypotension. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued infliximab treatment because of infusion reactions, and all patients recovered with treatment and/or discontinuation of the infusion. Infliximab infusions beyond the initial infusion were not associated with a higher incidence of reactions. The infusion reaction rates remained stable in Ps through 1-year in Ps Study I. In Ps Study II, the rates were variable over time and somewhat higher following the final infusion than after the initial infusion. Across the 3 Ps studies, the percent of total infusions resulting in infusion reactions (i.e., an adverse event occurring within 1 hour) was 7% in the 3 mg/kg group, 4% in the 5 mg/kg group, and 1% in the placebo group. Patients who became positive for antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately two- to three-fold) to have an infusion reaction than were those who were negative. Use of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to reduce the frequency of both antibodies to infliximab and infusion reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Infusion Reactions Following Re-administration In a clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe Ps designed to assess the efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of infliximab following disease flare, 4% (8/219) of patients in the re-treatment induction therapy arm experienced serious infusion reactions versus <1% (1/222) in the maintenance therapy arm. Patients enrolled in this trial did not receive any concomitant immunosuppressant therapy. In this study, the majority of serious infusion reactions occurred during the second infusion at Week 2. Symptoms included, but were not limited to, dyspnea, urticaria, facial edema, and hypotension. In all cases, treatment with infliximab was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Delayed Reactions/Reactions Following Re-administration In Ps studies, approximately 1% of infliximab-treated patients experienced a possible delayed hypersensitivity reaction, generally reported as serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever and/or rash. These reactions generally occurred within 2 weeks after repeat infusion. Infections In infliximab clinical studies, treated infections were reported in 36% of infliximab-treated patients (average of 51 weeks of follow-up) and in 25% of placebo-treated patients (average of 37 weeks of follow-up). The infections most frequently reported were respiratory tract infections (including sinusitis, pharyngitis, and bronchitis) and urinary tract infections. Among infliximab-treated patients, serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, skin ulceration, sepsis, and bacterial infection. In clinical trials, 7 opportunistic infections were reported; 2 cases each of coccidioidomycosis (1 case was fatal) and histoplasmosis (1 case was fatal), and 1 case each of pneumocystosis, nocardiosis and cytomegalovirus. Tuberculosis (TB) was reported in 14 patients, 4 of whom died due to miliary TB. Other cases of TB, including disseminated TB, also have been reported postmarketing. Most of these cases of TB occurred within the first 2 months after initiation of therapy with infliximab and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the 1-year placebo-controlled studies RA I and RA II, 5.3% of patients receiving infliximab every 8 weeks with MTX developed serious infections as compared to 3.4% of placebo patients receiving MTX. Of 924 patients receiving infliximab, 1.7% developed pneumonia and 0.4% developed TB, when compared to 0.3% and 0.0% in the placebo arm respectively. In a shorter (22-week) placebo-controlled study of 1082 RA patients randomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg infliximab infusions at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by every 8 weeks with MTX, serious infections were more frequent in the 10 mg/kg infliximab group (5.3%) than the 3 mg/kg or placebo groups (1.7% in both). During the 54-week Crohn's II Study, 15% of patients with fistulizing CD developed a new fistula-related abscess. In infliximab clinical studies in patients with UC, infections treated with antimicrobials were reported in 27% of infliximab-treated patients (average of 41 weeks of follow-up) and in 18% of placebo-treated patients (average 32 weeks of follow-up). The types of infections, including serious infections, reported in patients with UC were similar to those reported in other clinical studies. The onset of serious infections may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, and fatigue. The majority of serious infections, however, may also be preceded by signs or symptoms localized to the site of the infection. Autoantibodies/Lupus-like Syndrome Approximately half of the infliximab-treated patients in clinical trials who were antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative at baseline developed a positive ANA during the trial compared with approximately one-fifth of placebo-treated patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were newly detected in approximately one-fifth of infliximab-treated patients compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. Reports of lupus and lupus-like syndromes, however, remain uncommon. Malignancies In controlled trials, more infliximab-treated patients developed malignancies than placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In a randomized controlled clinical trial exploring the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe COPD who were either current smokers or ex-smokers, 157 patients were treated with infliximab at doses similar to those used in RA and CD. Of these infliximab-treated patients, 9 developed a malignancy, including 1 lymphoma, for a rate of 7.67 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 3.51 - 14.56). There was 1 reported malignancy among 77 control patients for a rate of 1.63 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 0.04 - 9.10). The majority of the malignancies developed in the lung or head and neck [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Adverse Reactions in Patients with NYHA Class III/IV Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind study evaluating infliximab in moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%), 150 patients were randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of infliximab 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg infliximab dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg infliximab group had died compared with 4 deaths each in the 5 mg/kg infliximab and the placebo groups. There were trends toward increased dyspnea, hypotension, angina, and dizziness in both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg infliximab treatment groups, versus placebo. Infliximab products have not been studied in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA Class I/II) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including acute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis, has been reported in patients receiving infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has occurred in patients receiving TNF blockers, including infliximab products, who are chronic carriers of this virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . In clinical trials in RA, CD, UC, AS, Ps, and PsA, elevations of aminotransferases were observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving infliximab than in controls (Table 1), both when infliximab was given as monotherapy and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In general, patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of infliximab, or modification of concomitant medications. Table 1: Proportion of Patients with Elevated ALT in Clinical Trials in Adults Proportion of patients with elevated ALT >1 to <3 × ULN ≥3 × ULN ≥5 × ULN Placebo Infliximab Placebo Infliximab Placebo Infliximab Rheumatoid arthritis Placebo patients received methotrexate while patients treated with infliximab received both infliximab and methotrexate. Median follow-up was 58 weeks. 24% 34% 3% 4% <1% <1% Crohn's disease Placebo patients in the 2 Phase 3 trials in CD received an initial dose of 5 mg/kg infliximab at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase. Patients who were randomized to the placebo maintenance group and then later crossed over to infliximab are included in the infliximab group in ALT analysis. Median follow-up was 54 weeks. 34% 39% 4% 5% 0% 2% Ulcerative colitis Median follow-up was 30 weeks. Specifically, the median duration of follow-up was 30 weeks for placebo and 31 weeks for infliximab. 12% 17% 1% 2% <1% <1% Ankylosing spondylitis Median follow-up was 24 weeks for the placebo group and 102 weeks for the infliximab group. 15% 51% 0% 10% 0% 4% Psoriatic arthritis Median follow-up was 39 weeks for the infliximab group and 18 weeks for the placebo group. 16% 50% 0% 7% 0% 2% Plaque psoriasis ALT values are obtained in 2 Phase 3 Ps studies with median follow-up of 50 weeks for infliximab and 16 weeks for placebo. 24% 49% <1% 8% 0% 3% Adverse Reactions in Psoriasis Studies During the placebo-controlled portion across the 3 clinical trials up to Week 16, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined as resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg infliximab group, 1.9% in the placebo group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group. Among patients in the 2 Phase 3 studies, 12.4% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1-year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE in Study I. In Study II, 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively, through 1-year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE. One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg infliximab. Serious infections included sepsis, and abscesses. In Study I, 2.7% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1-year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. In Study II, 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through 1-year of treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. The most common serious infection (requiring hospitalization) was abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by 5 (0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group. Two active cases of tuberculosis were reported: 6 weeks and 34 weeks after starting infliximab. In the placebo-controlled portion of the Ps studies, 7 of 1123 patients who received infliximab at any dose were diagnosed with at least one NMSC compared to 0 of 334 patients who received placebo. In the Ps studies, 1% (15/1373) of patients experienced serum sickness or a combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever, and/or rash, usually early in the treatment course. Of these patients, 6 required hospitalization due to fever, severe myalgia, arthralgia, swollen joints, and immobility. Other Adverse Reactions in Adults Safety data are available from 4779 infliximab-treated adult patients, including 1304 with RA, 1106 with CD, 484 with UC, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 1373 with Ps and 17 with other conditions. [For information on other adverse reactions in pediatric patients, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of all patients with RA receiving 4 or more infusions are in Table 2. The types and frequencies of adverse reactions observed were similar in RA, AS, PsA, Ps and CD patients treated with infliximab except for abdominal pain, which occurred in 26% of infliximab-treated patients with CD. In the CD studies, there were insufficient numbers and duration of follow-up for patients who never received infliximab to provide meaningful comparisons. Table 2: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in ≥ 5% of Patients who Received ≥4 Infliximab Infusions for RA Placebo Infliximab (n=350) (n=1129) Average weeks of follow-up 59 weeks 66 weeks Upper respiratory tract infection 25% 32% Nausea 20% 21% Headache 14% 18% Sinusitis 8% 14% Diarrhea 12% 12% Abdominal pain 8% 12% Pharyngitis 8% 12% Coughing 8% 12% Bronchitis 9% 10% Rash 5% 10% Dyspepsia 7% 10% Fatigue 7% 9% Urinary tract infection 6% 8% Pain 7% 8% Arthralgia 7% 8% Pruritus 2% 7% Fever 4% 7% Hypertension 5% 7% Moniliasis 3% 5% The most common serious adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Other serious, medically relevant adverse reactions ≥0.2% or clinically significant adverse reactions by body system were as follows: Body as a whole : allergic reaction, edema Blood : pancytopenia Cardiovascular : hypotension Gastrointestinal : constipation, intestinal obstruction Central and Peripheral Nervous : dizziness Heart Rate and Rhythm : bradycardia Liver and Biliary : hepatitis Metabolic and Nutritional : dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting : thrombocytopenia Neoplasms : lymphoma Red Blood Cell : anemia, hemolytic anemia Resistance Mechanism : cellulitis, sepsis, serum sickness, sarcoidosis Respiratory : lower respiratory tract infection (including pneumonia), pleurisy, pulmonary edema Skin and Appendages : increased sweating Vascular (Extracardiac) : thrombophlebitis White Cell and Reticuloendothelial : leukopenia, lymphadenopathy Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease There were some differences in the adverse reactions observed in the pediatric patients receiving infliximab compared to those observed in adults with CD. These differences are discussed in the following paragraphs. The following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in 103 randomized pediatric CD patients administered 5 mg/kg infliximab through 54 weeks than in 385 adult CD patients receiving a similar treatment regimen: anemia (11%), leukopenia (9%), flushing (9%), viral infection (8%), neutropenia (7%), bone fracture (7%), bacterial infection (6%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (6%). Infections were reported in 56% of randomized pediatric patients in Study Peds Crohn's and in 50% of adult patients in Study Crohn's I. In Study Peds Crohn's, infections were reported more frequently for patients who received every 8-week as opposed to every 12-week infusions (74% and 38%, respectively), while serious infections were reported for 3 patients in the every 8-week and 4 patients in the every 12-week maintenance treatment group. The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious infection was abscess. Pneumonia was reported for 3 patients, (2 in the every 8-week and 1 in the every 12-week maintenance treatment groups). Herpes zoster was reported for 2 patients in the every 8-week maintenance treatment group. In Study Peds Crohn's, 18% of randomized patients experienced 1 or more infusion reactions, with no notable difference between treatment groups. Of the 112 patients in Study Peds Crohn's, there were no serious infusion reactions, and 2 patients had non-serious anaphylactoid reactions. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 18% of pediatric patients in CD clinical trials; 4% had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 1% had elevations ≥5 × ULN. (Median follow-up was 53 weeks). Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Overall, the adverse reactions reported in the pediatric UC trial and adult UC (Study UC I and Study UC II) studies were generally consistent. In a pediatric UC trial, the most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, fever, and headache. Infections were reported in 31 (52%) of 60 treated patients in the pediatric UC trial and 22 (37%) required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients with infections in the pediatric UC trial was similar to that in the pediatric CD study (Study Peds Crohn's) but higher than the proportion in the adults' UC studies (Study UC I and Study UC II). The overall incidence of infections in the pediatric UC trial was 13/22 (59%) in the every 8-week maintenance treatment group. Upper respiratory tract infection (7/60 [12%]) and pharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently reported respiratory system infections. Serious infections were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients. Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 17% (10/60) of pediatric patients in the pediatric UC trial; 7% (4/60) had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 2% (1/60) had elevations ≥5 × ULN (median follow-up was 49 weeks). Overall, 8 of 60 (13%) treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions, including 4 of 22 (18%) patients in the every 8-week treatment maintenance group. No serious infusion reactions were reported. In the pediatric UC trial, 45 patients were in the 12- to 17-year age group and 15 in the 6- to 11-year age group. The numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to make any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events. There were higher proportions of patients with serious adverse events (40% vs. 18%) and discontinuation due to adverse events (40% vs. 16%) in the younger age group than in the older age group. While the proportion of patients with infections was also higher in the younger age group (60% vs. 49%), for serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two age groups (13% in the 6- to 11-year age group vs. 11% in the 12- to 17-year age group). Overall proportions of adverse reactions, including infusion reactions, were similar between the 6- to 11- and 12- to 17-year age groups (13%). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of infliximab or of other infliximab products. Treatment with infliximab products can be associated with the development of antibodies to infliximab products. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method was originally used to measure anti-infliximab antibodies in clinical studies of infliximab. The EIA method is subject to interference by serum infliximab, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the rate of patient antibody formation. A separate, drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method for detecting antibodies to infliximab was subsequently developed and validated. This method is 60-fold more sensitive than the original EIA. With the ECLIA method, all clinical samples can be classified as either positive or negative for antibodies to infliximab without the need for the inconclusive category. The incidence of antibodies to infliximab was based on the original EIA method in all clinical studies of infliximab except for the Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with UC where the incidence of antibodies to infliximab was detected using both the EIA and ECLIA methods. Immunogenicity in Adult Patients The incidence of antibodies to infliximab in patients with RA and CD given a 3-dose induction regimen followed by maintenance dosing was approximately 10% as assessed through 1 to 2 years of treatment with infliximab. A higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab was observed in CD patients receiving infliximab after drug-free intervals >16 weeks. In a study of PsA in which 191 patients received 5 mg/kg with or without MTX, antibodies to infliximab occurred in 15% of patients. The majority of antibody-positive patients had low titers. Antibody development was lower among RA and CD patients receiving immunosuppressant therapies such as 6-MP/AZA or MTX. Patients who were antibody-positive were more likely to have higher rates of clearance, have reduced efficacy and to experience an infusion reaction than were patients who were antibody negative [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In the Ps Study II, which included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 36% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year, and in 51% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year. In the Ps Study III, which also included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 20% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (Weeks 0, 2 and 6), and in 27% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg induction. Despite the increase in antibody formation, the infusion reaction rates in Studies I and II in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction followed by every 8-week maintenance for 1-year and in Study III in patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (14.1%-23.0%) and serious infusion reaction rates (<1%) were similar to those observed in other study populations. The clinical significance of apparent increased immunogenicity on efficacy and infusion reactions in Ps patients as compared to patients with other diseases treated with infliximab products over the long-term is not known. Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease In Study Peds Crohn's, in which all patients received stable doses of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, excluding inconclusive samples, 3 of 24 patients had antibodies to infliximab. Although 105 patients were tested for antibodies to infliximab, 81 patients were classified as inconclusive because they could not be ruled as negative due to assay interference by the presence of infliximab in the sample. Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis In the pediatric UC trial, 58 patients were evaluated for antibodies to infliximab using the EIA as well as the drug-tolerant ECLIA. With the EIA, 4 of 58 (7%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. With the ECLIA, 30 of 58 (52%) patients had antibodies to infliximab. The higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab by the ECLIA method was due to the 60-fold higher sensitivity compared to the EIA method. While EIA-positive patients generally had undetectable trough infliximab concentrations, ECLIA-positive patients could have detectable trough concentrations of infliximab because the ECLIA assay is more sensitive and drug-tolerant. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions, some with fatal outcomes, have been identified during post-approval use of infliximab products in adult and pediatric patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing Adverse Reactions in Adults and Pediatric Patients Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , agranulocytosis (including infants exposed in utero to infliximab products), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Interstitial lung disease (including pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial pneumonitis and rapidly progressive disease). Pericardial effusion, systemic and cutaneous vasculitis. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), worsening psoriasis (all subtypes including pustular, primarily palmoplantar), lichenoid reactions. Peripheral demyelinating disorders (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy) transverse myelitis, and neuropathies (additional neurologic reactions have also been observed) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] and vaccine breakthrough infection including bovine tuberculosis (disseminated BCG infection) following vaccination in an infant exposed in utero to infliximab products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . Malignancies, including leukemia, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema and severe bronchospasm, and seizure have been associated with administration of infliximab products. Transient visual loss have been reported in association with infliximab products during or within 2 hours of infusion. Cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial ischemia/infarction (some fatal), and arrhythmia occurring within 24 hours of initiation of infusion have also been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . New onset immune disorders (e.g., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease). Postmarketing Serious Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients The following serious adverse reactions have been reported in the postmarketing experience in pediatric patients: infections (some fatal) including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, infusion reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, malignancies, including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] , transient hepatic enzyme abnormalities, lupus-like syndromes, and the development of autoantibodies."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity) that occur during infusion and shortly after infusion. ( 2.11 ) AVSOLA is administered by intravenous infusion for at least 2 hours with an in-line filter. ( 2.11 ) Crohn's Disease: 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Some adult patients who initially respond to treatment may benefit from increasing the dose to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks if they later lose their response. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric Crohn's Disease (≥6 years old): 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.2 ) Ulcerative Colitis: 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.3 ) Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis (≥6 years old) : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.4 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis : In conjunction with methotrexate, 3 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. Some patients may benefit from increasing the dose up to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks or treating as often as every 4 weeks. ( 2.5 ) Ankylosing Spondylitis : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 6 weeks. ( 2.6 ) Psoriatic Arthritis and Plaque Psoriasis : 5 mg/kg at 0, 2 and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks. ( 2.7 , 2.8 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adult Crohn's Disease The recommended dosage of AVSOLA is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active CD or fistulizing CD. For adult patients who respond and then lose their response, consideration may be given to treatment with 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Patients who do not respond by Week 14 are unlikely to respond with continued dosing and consideration should be given to discontinue AVSOLA in these patients. 2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Crohn's Disease The recommended dosage of AVSOLA for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active CD is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. 2.3 Dosage in Adult Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dosage of AVSOLA is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC. 2.4 Dosage in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis The recommended dosage of AVSOLA for pediatric patients 6 years and older with moderately to severely active UC is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. 2.5 Dosage in Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dosage of AVSOLA is 3 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. AVSOLA should be given in combination with methotrexate. For patients who have an incomplete response, consideration may be given to adjusting the dosage up to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks or treating as often as every 4 weeks bearing in mind that risk of serious infections is increased at higher doses per infusion or more frequent dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.6 Dosage in Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosage of AVSOLA is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks thereafter for the treatment of active AS. 2.7 Dosage in Psoriatic Arthritis The recommended dosage of AVSOLA is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of PsA. AVSOLA can be used with or without methotrexate. 2.8 Dosage in Plaque Psoriasis The recommended dosage of AVSOLA in adult patients is 5 mg/kg given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2 and 6 weeks followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of chronic severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling) Ps. 2.9 Assessment for Latent and Active Tuberculosis Prior to initiating AVSOLA and periodically during therapy, patients should be evaluated for active tuberculosis and tested for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.10 Administration Instructions Regarding Infusion Reactions Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, other reactions) that occur during infusion and shortly after infusion. Prior to infusion with AVSOLA, patients may be premedicated with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . For mild to moderate reactions during the infusion, consider slowing or stopping the infusion. Upon resolution of these reactions, may reinitiate at a lower infusion rate and/or with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids. Discontinue the infusion if the mild to moderate reactions reoccur. Discontinue the infusion if severe hypersensitivity reactions occur during the infusion. 2.11 Reconstitution, Dilution, and Administration Instructions AVSOLA is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare provider. The supplied lyophilized powder must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration. The infusion solution should be prepared and administered by a trained medical professional using aseptic technique by the following procedure: Calculate the dose, total volume of reconstituted AVSOLA solution required and the number of AVSOLA vials needed. More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Reconstitute each 100 mg AVSOLA vial with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to obtain a concentration of 10 mg/mL, using a syringe equipped with a 21-gauge or smaller needle as follows: Remove the flip-top from the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through the center of the rubber stopper and direct the stream of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to the glass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The reconstituted solution should be colorless to light yellow and opalescent, and the solution may develop a few translucent particles as infliximab-axxq is a protein. Do not use if the lyophilized powder has not fully dissolved or if opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particles are present. Do not store unused reconstituted AVSOLA solution. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted AVSOLA solution to 250 mL For volumes greater than 250 mL, either use a larger infusion bag (e.g. 500 mL) or multiple 250 mL infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion solution does not exceed 4 mg/mL. with sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, (do not dilute with any other diluent) as follows: Withdraw a volume from the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 250 mL bottle or bag equal to the total volume of reconstituted AVSOLA required for a dose. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted AVSOLA solution from the vial(s) to the 250 mL infusion bottle or bag. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted AVSOLA solution remaining in the vial(s). Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The resulting infusion concentration should range between 0.4 mg/mL (minimum recommended concentration) and 4 mg/mL (maximum recommended concentration) of infliximab-axxq. The AVSOLA infusion should begin within 3 hours of reconstitution and dilution. The infusion must be administered intravenously for at least 2 hours with an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding filter (pore size of 1.2 µm or less). Given that the vials do not contain antibacterial preservatives, discard any unused portion of the infusion solution (do not store for reuse). No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-administration of AVSOLA with other agents. AVSOLA should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning Increased risk of serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections (such as hitoplasmosis) and infections due to ohter opportunistic pathogens. (5.1) Discontinue ZYMFENTRA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. (5.1) Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting ZYMFENTRA. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. (5.1) Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including infliximab products. (5.2) Postmarketing cases of fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including infliximab products. Almost all had received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of cases were reported in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, most of whom were adolescent or young adult males. (5.2 ) SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with TNF blockers, inculding ZYMFENTRA, are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue ZYMFENTRA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patientsfor latent tuberculosis before ZYMFENTRA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent infection prior to ZYMFENTRA use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with ZYMFENTRA prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symtoms of infection during and after treatment with ZYMFENTRA, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including infliximab products [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including infliximab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were in young adult males. [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8.4 ) ]."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with CIMZIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. CIMZIA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before CIMZIA use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to CIMZIA use. Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. The risks and benefits of treatment with CIMZIA should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIMZIA, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, of which CIMZIA is a member [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions were: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hematologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Autoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Most common adverse reactions (≥7%): upper respiratory tract infection, rash, and urinary tract infection ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact UCB, Inc. at 1-866-822-0068 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug, and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice. In premarketing controlled trials of all adult patient populations combined the most common adverse reactions (≥ 8%) were upper respiratory infections (18%), rash (9%) and urinary tract infections (8%). Adverse Reactions Most Commonly Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment in Premarketing Controlled Trials The proportion of patients with Crohn's disease who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the controlled clinical studies was 8% for CIMZIA and 7% for placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to the discontinuation of CIMZIA (for at least 2 patients and with a higher incidence than placebo) were abdominal pain (0.4% CIMZIA, 0.2% placebo), diarrhea (0.4% CIMZIA, 0% placebo), and intestinal obstruction (0.4% CIMZIA, 0% placebo). The proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the controlled clinical studies was 5% for CIMZIA and 2.5% for placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of CIMZIA were tuberculosis infections (0.5%); and pyrexia, urticaria, pneumonia, and rash (0.3%). Controlled Studies with Crohn's Disease The data described below reflect exposure to CIMZIA at 400 mg subcutaneous dosing in studies of patients with Crohn's disease. In the safety population in controlled studies, a total of 620 patients with Crohn's disease received CIMZIA at a dose of 400 mg, and 614 subjects received placebo (including subjects randomized to placebo in Study CD2 following open-label dosing of CIMZIA at Weeks 0, 2, 4). In controlled and uncontrolled studies, 1,564 patients received CIMZIA at some dose level, of whom 1,350 patients received 400 mg CIMZIA. Approximately 55% of subjects were female, 45% were male, and 94% were Caucasian. The majority of patients in the active group were between the ages of 18 and 64. During controlled clinical studies, the proportion of patients with serious adverse reactions was 10% for CIMZIA and 9% for placebo. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 5% of CIMZIA-treated patients, and with a higher incidence compared to placebo) in controlled clinical studies with CIMZIA were upper respiratory infections (e.g. nasopharyngitis, laryngitis, viral infection) in 20% of CIMZIA-treated patients and 13% of placebo-treated patients, urinary tract infections (e.g. bladder infection, bacteriuria, cystitis) in 7% of CIMZIA-treated patients and in 6% of placebo-treated patients, and arthralgia (6% CIMZIA, 4% placebo). Other Adverse Reactions The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in controlled trials of Crohn's disease were described above. Other serious or significant adverse reactions reported in controlled and uncontrolled studies in Crohn's disease and other diseases, occurring in patients receiving CIMZIA at doses of 400 mg or other doses include: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, and thrombophilia. Cardiac disorders: Angina pectoris, arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, hypertensive heart disease, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, stroke and transient ischemic attack. Eye disorders: Optic neuritis, retinal hemorrhage, and uveitis. General disorders and administration site conditions: Bleeding and injection site reactions. Hepatobiliary disorders : Elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis. Immune system disorders : Alopecia totalis. Psychiatric disorders: Anxiety, bipolar disorder, and suicide attempt. Renal and urinary disorders: Nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Reproductive system and breast disorders: Menstrual disorder. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria. Vascular disorders: Thrombophlebitis, vasculitis. Controlled Studies with Rheumatoid Arthritis CIMZIA was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow-up studies. The data described below reflect the exposure to CIMZIA in 2,367 RA patients, including 2,030 exposed for at least 6 months, 1,663 exposed for at least one year and 282 for at least 2 years; and 1,774 in adequate and well-controlled studies. In placebo-controlled studies, the population had a median age of 53 years at entry; approximately 80% were females, 93% were Caucasian and all patients were suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis, with a median disease duration of 6.2 years. Most patients received the recommended dose of CIMZIA or higher. Table 1 summarizes the reactions reported at a rate of at least 3% in patients treated with CIMZIA 200 mg every other week compared to placebo (saline formulation), given concomitantly with methotrexate. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥3% of Patients Treated with CIMZIA Dosed Every Other Week during Placebo-Controlled Period of Rheumatoid Arthritis Studies, with Concomitant Methotrexate.

These adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients with a baseline history of hypertension and among patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients receiving CIMZIA 400 mg as monotherapy every 4 weeks in rheumatoid arthritis controlled clinical trials had similar adverse reactions to those patients receiving CIMZIA 200 mg every other week. Other Adverse Reactions Other infrequent adverse reactions (occurring in less than 3% of RA patients) were similar to those seen in Crohn's disease patients. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical Study CIMZIA has been studied in 193 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with active polyarthritis aged 2 years and older. In general, the safety profile for pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis was similar to the safety profile seen in adult RA patients treated with CIMZIA. Psoriatic Arthritis Clinical Study CIMZIA has been studied in 409 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in a placebo-controlled trial. The safety profile for patients with PsA treated with CIMZIA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA and previous experience with CIMZIA . Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Study CIMZIA has been studied in 325 patients with axial spondyloarthritis of whom the majority had ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a placebo-controlled study (AS-1). The safety profile for patients in study AS-1 treated with CIMZIA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA. Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis Clinical Study CIMZIA has been studied in 317 patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA-1). The safety profile for patients with nr-axSpA treated with CIMZIA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA and previous experience with CIMZIA. Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies In clinical studies, a total of 1112 subjects with plaque psoriasis were treated with CIMZIA. Of these, 779 subjects were exposed for at least 12 months, 551 for 18 months, and 66 for 24 months. Data from three placebo-controlled studies (Studies PS-1, PS-2, and PS-3) in 1020 subjects (mean age 46 years, 66% males, 94% white) were pooled to evaluate the safety of CIMZIA [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] . Placebo-Controlled Period (Week 0-16) In the placebo-controlled period of Studies PS-1, PS-2 and PS-3 in the 400 mg group, adverse events occurred in 63.5% of subjects in the CIMZIA group compared to 61.8% of subjects in the placebo group. The rates of serious adverse events were 4.7% in the CIMZIA group and 4.5% in the placebo group. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the CIMZIA group than in the placebo group. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of Subjects in the CIMZIA Group and More Frequently than in the Placebo Group in the Plaque Psoriasis Studies PS-1, PS-2, and PS-3.

Of CIMZIA-treated subjects who had elevation of liver enzymes, two subjects were discontinued from the trial. In controlled Phase 3 studies of CIMZIA in adults with PsO with a controlled period duration ranging from 0 to 16 weeks, AST and/or ALT elevations ≥5 × ULN occurred in 0.9% of CIMZIA 200 mg or CIMZIA 400 mg arms and none in placebo arm. Psoriasis-Related Adverse Events In controlled clinical studies in psoriasis, change of plaque psoriasis into a different psoriasis sub-types (including erythrodermic, pustular and guttate), was observed in <1% of Cimzia treated subjects. Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Across Indications Infections The incidence of infections in controlled studies in Crohn's disease was 38% for CIMZIA-treated patients and 30% for placebo-treated patients. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory infections (20% for CIMZIA, 13% for placebo). The incidence of serious infections during the controlled clinical studies was 3% per patient-year for CIMZIA-treated patients and 1% for placebo-treated patients. Serious infections observed included bacterial and viral infections, pneumonia, and pyelonephritis. The incidence of new cases of infections in controlled clinical studies in rheumatoid arthritis was 0.91 per patient-year for all CIMZIA-treated patients and 0.72 per patient-year for placebo-treated patients. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections, herpes infections, urinary tract infections, and lower respiratory tract infections. In the controlled rheumatoid arthritis studies, there were more new cases of serious infection adverse reactions in the CIMZIA treatment groups, compared to the placebo groups (0.06 per patient-year for all CIMZIA doses vs. 0.02 per patient-year for placebo). Rates of serious infections in the 200 mg every other week dose group were 0.06 per patient-year and in the 400 mg every 4 weeks dose group were 0.04 per patient-year. Serious infections included tuberculosis, pneumonia, cellulitis, and pyelonephritis. In the placebo group, no serious infection occurred in more than one subject. There is no evidence of increased risk of infections with continued exposure over time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In controlled clinical studies in psoriasis, the incidence rates of infections were similar in the CIMZIA and placebo groups. The infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infections and viral infections (including herpes infections). Serious adverse events of infection occurred in CIMZIA-treated patients during the placebo-controlled periods of the pivotal studies (pneumonia, abdominal abscess, and hematoma infection) and Phase 2 study (urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, and disseminated tuberculosis). In an open-label clinical study of 193 pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, there were 26 serious infections; the most frequently reported serious infection was pneumonia. Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections In completed and ongoing global clinical studies in all indications including 5,118 CIMZIA-treated patients, the overall rate of tuberculosis is approximately 0.61 per 100 patient-years across all indications. The majority of cases occurred in countries with high endemic rates of TB. Reports include cases of disseminated (miliary, lymphatic, and peritoneal) as well as pulmonary TB. The median time to onset of TB for all patients exposed to CIMZIA across all indications was 345 days. In the studies with CIMZIA in RA, there were 36 cases of TB among 2,367 exposed patients, including some fatal cases. Rare cases of opportunistic infections have also been reported in these clinical trials. In Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies with CIMZIA in plaque psoriasis, there were 2 cases of TB among 1112 exposed patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In an open-label clinical study of 193 pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, opportunistic infections consisted of tuberculosis, liver tuberculosis, varicella, pneumonia fungal, and esophageal candidiasis. Two cases of disseminated tuberculosis (liver TB and disseminated TB) were fatal. Malignancies In clinical studies of CIMZIA, the overall incidence rate of malignancies was similar for CIMZIA-treated and control patients. For some TNF blockers, more cases of malignancies have been observed among patients receiving those TNF blockers compared to control patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled and open-label studies, cases of new or worsening heart failure have been reported for CIMZIA-treated patients. The majority of these cases were mild to moderate and occurred during the first year of exposure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions The following symptoms that could be compatible with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely following CIMZIA administration to patients: angioedema, allergic dermatitis, dizziness (postural), dyspnea, hot flush, hypotension, injection site reactions, malaise, pyrexia, rash, serum sickness, and (vasovagal) syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Autoantibodies In clinical studies in Crohn's disease, 4% of patients treated with CIMZIA and 2% of patients treated with placebo that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers during the studies. One of the 1,564 Crohn's disease patients treated with CIMZIA developed symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome. In clinical trials of TNF blockers, including CIMZIA, in patients with RA, some patients have developed ANA. Four patients out of 2,367 patients treated with CIMZIA in RA clinical studies developed clinical signs suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome. The impact of long-term treatment with CIMZIA on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. In a clinical study in pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, 17.1% of patients treated with CIMZIA that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers during the study. 1.1% of the patients developed anti-dsDNA antibodies during the study; no patients developed symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of certolizumab pegol or of other certolizumab products. Patients with Crohn's disease were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to certolizumab pegol during Studies CD1 and CD2. In patients continuously exposed to CIMZIA, the overall percentage of patients who were antibody positive to CIMZIA on at least one occasion was 8%; approximately 6% were neutralizing in vitro . No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse events or efficacy was observed. Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressants had a lower rate of antibody development than patients not taking immunosuppressants at baseline (3% and 11%, respectively). The following adverse events were reported in Crohn's disease patients who were antibody-positive (N = 100) at an incidence at least 3% higher compared to antibody-negative patients (N = 1,242): abdominal pain, arthralgia, edema peripheral, erythema nodosum, injection site erythema, injection site pain, pain in extremity, and upper respiratory tract infection. In two long-term (up to 7 years of exposure), open-label Crohn's disease studies, overall 23% (207/903) of patients developed antibodies against certolizumab pegol on at least one occasion. Of the 207 patients who were antibody positive, 152 (73%) had a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration, which represents 17% (152/903) of the study population. The data from these two studies do not suggest an association between the development of antibodies and adverse events. The overall percentage of patients with antibodies to certolizumab pegol detectable on at least one occasion was 7% (105 of 1,509) in the rheumatoid arthritis placebo-controlled trials. Approximately one third (3%, 39 of 1,509) of these patients had antibodies with neutralizing activity in vitro . Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressants (MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients not taking immunosuppressants at baseline. Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressant therapy (MTX) in RA-I, RA-II, RA-III had a lower rate of neutralizing antibody formation overall than patients treated with CIMZIA monotherapy in RA-IV (2% vs. 8%). Both the loading dose of 400 mg every other week at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 and concomitant use of MTX were associated with reduced immunogenicity. Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and reduced efficacy. In patients receiving the recommended CIMZIA dosage of 200 mg every other week with concomitant MTX, the ACR20 response was lower among antibody positive patients than among antibody-negative patients (Study RA-I, 48% versus 60%; Study RA-II 35% versus 59%, respectively). In Study RA-III, too few patients developed antibodies to allow for meaningful analysis of ACR20 response by antibody status. In Study RA-IV (monotherapy), the ACR20 response was 33% versus 56%, antibody-positive versus antibody-negative status, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No association was seen between antibody development and the development of adverse events. Approximately 8 % (22/265) and 19% (54/281) of subjects with psoriasis who received CIMZIA 400 mg every 2 weeks and CIMZIA 200 mg every 2 weeks for 48 weeks, respectively, developed antibodies to certolizumab pegol. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to certolizumab pegol, 45% (27/60) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and reduced efficacy. A more sensitive and drug tolerant electrochemiluminesence (ECL)-based bridging assay was used for the first time in the nr-axSpA-1 study, resulting in a greater proportion of samples having measurable antibodies to certolizumab pegol and thus a greater incidence of patients being classed as antibody positive. In the placebo-controlled trial in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, after up to 52 weeks of treatment, the overall incidence of patients who were antibody positive to certolizumab pegol was 97% (248/255 patients). Of these antibody positive patients, higher titers were associated with reduced certolizumab pegol plasma levels. The data above reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to certolizumab pegol in an ELISA or ECL-based bridging assay, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. In a clinical study of pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, immunogenicity was evaluated using an ECL-based assay. For the patients receiving the recommended CIMZIA dose, the incidence of treatment emergent-anti-certolizumab pegol antibody positivity was 92.4% for the entire treatment period. Of these antibody positive patients, higher titers were associated with reduced certolizumab pegol plasma levels. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CIMZIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Vascular disorder : systemic vasculitis has been identified during post-approval use of TNF blockers. Skin : case of severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), and lichenoid skin reaction have been identified during post-approval use of TNF blockers. Immune System Disorders : sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION CIMZIA is administered by subcutaneous injection . Injection sites should be rotated and injections should not be given into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. When a 400 mg dose is needed (given as two subcutaneous injections of 200 mg), injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. The solution should be carefully inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be a clear to opalescent, colorless to yellow liquid, essentially free from particulates and should not be used if cloudy or if foreign particulate matter is present. CIMZIA does not contain preservatives; therefore, unused portions of drug remaining in the syringe or vial should be discarded. CIMZIA is administered by subcutaneous injection ( 2 ).

In patients who obtain a clinical response, the recommended maintenance regimen is 400 mg every four weeks. 2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended dose of CIMZIA for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 400 mg (given as two subcutaneous injections of 200 mg) initially and at Weeks 2 and 4, followed by 200 mg every other week. For maintenance dosing, CIMZIA 400 mg every 4 weeks can be considered [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . 2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The recommended dose of CIMZIA for patients 2 years of age and older with pJIA is based on weight as shown below. Weight range (2 years of age and older) Loading dose Maintenance dose (beginning at Week 6) 10 kg (22 lbs) to less than 20 kg (44 lbs) 100 mg at Week 0, 2 and 4 50 mg every 2 weeks 20 kg (44 lbs) to less than 40 kg (88 lbs) 200 mg at Week 0, 2 and 4 100 mg every 2 weeks Greater than or equal to 40 kg (88 lbs) 400 mg at Week 0, 2 and 4 200 mg every 2 weeks There is no dosage form for Cimzia that allows for patient self-administration for doses below 200 mg. Doses less than 200 mg require administration by a health care professional using the vial kit. 2.4 Psoriatic Arthritis The recommended dose of CIMZIA for adult patients with psoriatic arthritis is 400 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) initially and at week 2 and 4, followed by 200 mg every other week. For maintenance dosing, CIMZIA 400 mg every 4 weeks can be considered [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . 2.5 Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dose of CIMZIA for adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis is 400 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) initially and at weeks 2 and 4, followed by 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks. 2.6 Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis The recommended dose of CIMZIA for adult patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis is 400 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) initially and at weeks 2 and 4, followed by 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks. 2.7 Plaque Psoriasis The recommended dose of CIMZIA for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is 400 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) every other week. For some patients (with body weight less than or equal to 90 kg), CIMZIA 400 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) initially and at Weeks 2 and 4, followed by 200 mg every other week can be considered [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] . 2.8 Preparation and Administration of CIMZIA Using the Lyophilized Powder for Injection CIMZIA Lyophilized powder should be prepared and administered by a health care professional. CIMZIA is provided in a package that contains everything required to reconstitute and inject the drug [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Step-by-step preparation and administration instructions are provided below. Preparation and Storage If refrigerated, remove CIMZIA from the refrigerator and allow the vial(s) to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before reconstituting. Do not warm the vial in any other way. Use appropriate aseptic technique when preparing and administering CIMZIA. Reconstitute the vial(s) of CIMZIA with 1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP using the 20-gauge needle provided. The sterile water for injection should be directed at the vial wall rather than directly on CIMZIA. Gently swirl each vial of CIMZIA for about one minute without shaking, assuring that all of the powder comes in contact with the Sterile Water for Injection. The swirling should be as gentle as possible in order to avoid creating a foaming effect. Continue swirling every 5 minutes as long as non-dissolved particles are observed. Full reconstitution may take as long as 30 minutes. The final reconstituted solution contains 200 mg/mL and should be clear to opalescent, colorless to yellow liquid essentially free from particulates. Once reconstituted, CIMZIA can be stored in the vials for up to 24 hours between 2° to 8° C (36° to 46° F) prior to injection. Do not freeze. Administration Prior to injecting, reconstituted CIMZIA should be at room temperature but do not leave reconstituted CIMZIA at room temperature for more than two hours prior to administration. Withdraw the reconstituted solution into a separate syringe for each vial using a new 20-gauge needle for each vial so that each syringe contains the required volume of CIMZIA [see Dosage and Administration (2.1-2.7)] . Replace the 20-gauge needle(s) on the syringes with a 23-gauge(s) for administration. Inject the full contents of the syringe(s) subcutaneously , by pinching the skin of the thigh or abdomen. Where a 400 mg dose is required, two injections are required, therefore, separate sites should be used for each 200 mg injection. 2.9 Preparation and Administration of CIMZIA Using the Prefilled Syringe After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, a patient may self-inject with the CIMZIA Prefilled Syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate. If refrigerated, remove the prefilled syringe from the carton and let it warm to room temperature. Inspect the liquid in the prefilled syringe. It should be clear to opalescent and colorless to yellow and free from particulates. Discard the syringe if cloudy, discolored or contains particulates. Suitable sites for injection include the thigh or abdomen at least 2 inches away from the navel. Inject at least 1 inch from the previous site. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard, or where there are scars or stretch marks. The needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA prefilled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions and should be handled with caution by latex-sensitive individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 2.10 Monitoring to Assess Safety Before initiation of therapy with CIMZIA, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection. The possibility of undetected latent tuberculosis should be considered in patients who have immigrated from or traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis or had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis. Appropriate screening tests (e.g. tuberculin skin test and chest x-ray) should be performed in all patients. 2.11 Concomitant Medications CIMZIA may be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with non-biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The use of CIMZIA in combination with biological DMARDs or other tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker therapy is not recommended."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death including tuberculosis (TB), bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal (such as histoplasmosis), and other opportunistic infections have occurred in patients receiving SIMPONI ARIA ( 5.1 ). Discontinue SIMPONI ARIA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis ( 5.1 ). Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting SIMPONI ARIA ( 5.1 ). Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative ( 5.1 ). Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, of which SIMPONI ARIA is a member ( 5.2 ). SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with SIMPONI ARIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue SIMPONI ARIA if a patient develops a serious infection. Reported infections with TNF blockers, of which SIMPONI ARIA is a member, include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent tuberculosis before SIMPONI ARIA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent tuberculosis prior to SIMPONI ARIA use. Invasive fungal infections including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric antifungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment with SIMPONI ARIA prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with SIMPONI ARIA, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . MALIGNANCY Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF-blockers, of which SIMPONI ARIA is a member [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions were: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 3%) are: upper respiratory tract infection, alanine aminotransferase increased, viral infection, aspartate aminotransferase increased, neutrophil count decreased, bronchitis, hypertension, and rash ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Biotech, Inc. at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety data described below are based on one, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 trial in patients with RA receiving SIMPONI ARIA by intravenous infusion (Trial RA). The protocol included provisions for patients taking placebo to receive treatment with SIMPONI ARIA at Week 16 or Week 24 either by patient response (based on uncontrolled disease activity) or by design, so that adverse events cannot always be unambiguously attributed to a given treatment. Comparisons between placebo and SIMPONI ARIA were based on the first 24 weeks of exposure. Trial RA included 197 control-treated patients and 463 SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients (which includes control-treated patients who switched to SIMPONI ARIA at Week 16). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the controlled phase of Trial RA through Week 24 was 3.5% for SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and 0.5% for placebo-treated patients. Upper respiratory tract infection was the most common adverse reaction reported in the trial through Week 24 occurring in 6.5% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients as compared with 7.6% of control-treated patients, respectively. Infections Serious infections observed in SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients included sepsis, pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis (TB), and invasive fungal infections. Cases of TB included pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. The majority of the TB cases occurred in countries with a high incidence rate of TB [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the controlled phase of Trial RA through Week 24, infections were observed in 27% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients compared with 24% of control-treated patients, and serious infections were observed in 0.9% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and 0.0% of control-treated patients. Through Week 24, the incidence of serious infections per 100 patient-years of follow-up was 2.2 (95% CI 0.61, 5.71) for the SIMPONI ARIA group, and 0 (0.00, 3.79) for the placebo group. In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of Trial RA, 958 total patient-years of follow-up with a median follow-up of approximately 92 weeks, the incidence per 100 patient-years of all serious infections was 4.07 (95% CI: 2.90, 5.57) in patients receiving SIMPONI ARIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of Trial RA, in SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients, the incidence of active TB per 100 patient-years was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.06; 0.92) and the incidence of other opportunistic infections per 100 patient-years was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.11, 1.07). Malignancies One case of malignancy other than lymphoma and NMSC with SIMPONI ARIA was reported through Week 24 during the controlled phase of Trial RA. In the controlled and uncontrolled portions through approximately 92 weeks, the incidence of malignancies per 100 patient-years, other than lymphoma and NMSC, in SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.92) and the incidence of NMSC was 0.1 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.58). Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In the controlled phase of Trial RA, through Week 24, ALT elevations ≥ 5 × ULN occurred in 0.8% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and 0% of control-treated patients and ALT elevations ≥ 3 × ULN occurred in 2.3% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and 2.5% of control-treated patients. In the controlled phase of Trial PsA, through Week 24, ALT elevations ≥ 5 × ULN occurred in 1.7% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and <1% of placebo-treated patients, and ALT elevations ≥ 3 × ULN to < 5 × ULN occurred in 2.9% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and <1% of placebo-treated patients. Since many of the patients in the Phase 3 trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], MTX, or isoniazid prophylaxis), the relationship between SIMPONI ARIA and liver enzyme elevation is not clear. Autoimmune Disorders and Autoantibodies At Week 20 in Trial RA, 17% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and 13% of control patients were newly antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive. Of these patients, one SIMPONI ARIA-treated patient and no control-treated patients had newly positive anti-dsDNA antibodies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Administration Reactions In the controlled phase of Trial RA through Week 24, 1.1% of SIMPONI ARIA infusions were associated with an infusion reaction compared with 0.2% of infusions in the control group. The most common infusion reaction in SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients was rash. No serious infusion reactions were reported. Other Adverse Reactions Table 1 summarizes the adverse drug reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in the SIMPONI ARIA + MTX group with a higher incidence than in the placebo + MTX group during the controlled period of Trial RA through Week 24. Table 1: Adverse Drug Reactions Reported by ≥ 1% of SIMPONI ARIA-Treated Patients and with a Higher Incidence than Placebo-Treated Patients in Trial RA through Week 24 Placebo + MTX SIMPONI ARIA + MTX Patients treated 197 463 Adverse Reaction Infections and infestations Upper respiratory tract infection (such as upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, and rhinitis) 12% 13% Viral infections (such as influenza and herpes) 3% 4% Bacterial infections 0% 1% Bronchitis 1% 3% Vascular disorders Hypertension 2% 3% Skin and subcutaneous disorders Rash 1% 3% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 1% 2% Blood and lymphatic disorders Leukopenia 0% 1% Other and Less Common Clinical Trial Adverse Drug Reactions Adverse drug reactions that do not appear in Table 1 or that occurred < 1% in SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients during Trial RA through Week 24 that do not appear in the Warnings and Precautions section included the following events listed by system organ class: Infections and infestations: Superficial fungal infection, sinusitis, abscess, lower respiratory tract infection (pneumonia), pyelonephritis Investigations: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, neutrophil count decreased Nervous system disorders: Dizziness, paresthesia Gastrointestinal disorders: Constipation Psoriatic Arthritis Trial PsA evaluated 480 patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The adverse reactions were similar to those observed in patients with RA, with the exception of psoriasis (new onset or worsening, palmar/plantar and pustular), which occurred in <1% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients. The incidence of the adverse reactions reported in Trial PsA were similar to Trial RA with the exceptions of higher incidence in SIMPONI ARIA for ALT increased (7.9% vs. 2.1% in placebo), AST increased (5.4% vs. 2.1% in placebo), and neutrophil count decreased (4.6% vs. 2.1% in placebo). Ankylosing Spondylitis Trial AS evaluated 208 patients [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The adverse reactions were similar to those reported in patients with RA, with the exception of the higher incidence of ALT increased, which occurred in 2.9% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients compared with none of the placebo-treated patients. Pediatric Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis Trial pJIA evaluated 127 patients with JIA with active polyarthritis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with the established safety profile of SIMPONI ARIA in adult patients with RA and PsA. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to golimumab in the trials described below with the incidence of antibodies in other trials or to other products may be misleading. Using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method, antibodies to golimumab were detected in 13 (3%) golimumab-treated patients following IV administration of SIMPONI ARIA in combination with MTX through Week 24 of Trial RA, of which all were neutralizing antibodies. A drug-tolerant enzyme immunoassay (drug-tolerant EIA) method for detecting antibodies to golimumab was developed and validated. This method is approximately 16-fold more sensitive than the original EIA method with less interference from golimumab in serum. Through approximately 6 months, the incidence of antibodies to golimumab with the drug-tolerant EIA method for Trials RA, PsA, AS, and pJIA was 21%, 19%, 19% and 31%, respectively. Where tested, approximately one-third to one-half were neutralizing. Patients with RA, PsA, AS and pJIA who developed antibodies to golimumab generally had lower trough steady-state serum concentrations of golimumab [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of golimumab. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to golimumab exposure: General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Neoplasm benign and malignant : Melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Immune system disorders : Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] , sarcoidosis Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Interstitial lung disease Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Skin exfoliation, lichenoid reactions, bullous skin reactions"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis: 2 mg/kg intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter ( 2.1 ) Pediatric patients with polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: 80 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter ( 2.2 ) Dilution of supplied SIMPONI ARIA solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is required prior to administration. Alternatively, 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can also be used ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage in Adults with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis The SIMPONI ARIA dosage regimen is 2 mg per kg given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Follow the dilution and administration instructions for SIMPONI ARIA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SIMPONI ARIA should be given in combination with methotrexate. The efficacy and safety of switching between intravenous and subcutaneous formulations and routes of administration have not been established. 2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis The SIMPONI ARIA dosage regimen, based on body surface area (BSA), is 80 mg/m 2 given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Follow the dilution and administration instructions for SIMPONI ARIA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 2.3 Evaluation for Tuberculosis and Hepatitis B Prior to Dosage Prior to initiating SIMPONI ARIA and periodically during therapy, evaluate patients for active tuberculosis and test for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Prior to initiating SIMPONI ARIA, test patients for hepatitis B viral infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.4 Important Administration Instructions SIMPONI ARIA solution for intravenous infusion should be diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique as follows: Calculate the dosage and the number of SIMPONI ARIA vials needed based on the recommended adult dosage of 2 mg/kg and the patient's weight for RA, PsA and AS. Calculate the dosage and number of SIMPONI ARIA vials needed based on the recommended pediatric dosage of 80 mg/m 2 and the patient's body surface area (BSA), for pJIA and pediatric patients with PsA. Each 4 mL vial of SIMPONI ARIA contains 50 mg of golimumab. Check that the solution in each vial is colorless to light yellow. The solution may develop a few fine translucent particles, as golimumab is a protein. Do not use if opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particles are present. Dilute the total volume of the SIMPONI ARIA solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to a final volume of 100 mL. For example, this can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 100-mL infusion bag or bottle equal to the total volume of SIMPONI ARIA. Slowly add the total volume of SIMPONI ARIA solution to the 100-mL infusion bag or bottle. Gently mix. Discard any unused solution remaining in the vials. Alternatively, SIMPONI ARIA can be diluted using the same method described above with 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Prior to infusion, visually inspect the diluted SIMPONI ARIA solution for particulate matter or discoloration. Do not use if these are present. Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.22 micrometer or less). Do not infuse SIMPONI ARIA concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the use of SIMPONI ARIA with other intravenous agents in the same intravenous line. Infuse the diluted solution over 30 minutes. Once diluted, the infusion solution can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature."

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of Subcutaneous COSENTYX Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults with PsO A total of 3,430 adult subjects with PsO were treated with COSENTYX in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials. Of these, 1,641 subjects were treated with COSENTYX for at least 1 year. Four placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials in PsO subjects (Trials PsO1, PsO2, PsO3, and PsO4) were pooled to evaluate the safety of COSENTYX in comparison to placebo up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation. In total, 2,077 subjects were evaluated (691 in the COSENTYX 300 mg group, 692 in the COSENTYX 150 mg group, and 694 in the placebo group). Subjects randomized to COSENTYX received 300 mg or 150 mg doses subcutaneously at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14)] .

Infections In the placebo-controlled period of the clinical trials in PsO (a total of 1,382 subjects treated with COSENTYX and 694 subjects treated with placebo up to 12 weeks), infections were reported in 28.7% of subjects treated with COSENTYX compared with 18.9% of subjects treated with placebo. Over the entire treatment period (a total of 3,430 PsO subjects treated with COSENTYX for up to 52 weeks for the majority of subjects), infections were reported in 47.5% of subjects treated with COSENTYX (0.9 per subject-year of follow-up) and serious infections were reported in 1.2% of subjects treated with COSENTYX (0.015 per subject-year of follow-up). Phase 3 data showed an increasing trend for some types of infection with increasing serum secukinumab concentrations. Candida infections, herpes viral infections, staphylococcal skin infections, and infections requiring treatment increased as serum secukinumab concentration increased. In the PsO open-label extension of Trials PsO1 and PsO2 (median follow-up of 3.9 years), representing 3,582 subject-years of exposure, 74% of COSENTYX treated subjects reported infections (55 per 100 subject-years) and serious infections were reported in 4.5% of COSENTYX treated subjects (1.4 per 100 subject-years). Sepsis was reported in 5 COSENTYX treated subjects (0.2 per 100 subject-years). Neutropenia was observed in controlled portion of clinical trials. Most cases of COSENTYX associated neutropenia were transient and reversible. No serious infections were associated with cases of neutropenia. In the open-label extension of Trials PsO1 and PsO2, neutropenia (ANC < 1 x 10 9 /L) was reported in 1% of COSENTYX treated subjects (0.3 per 100 subject-years). Some cases of serious infections were associated with neutropenia; however, the causal relationship was not established. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cases of IBD, in some cases serious, were observed in subjects treated with COSENTYX in clinical trials. In the PsO program, with 3,430 subjects exposed to COSENTYX over the entire treatment period for up to 52 weeks (2,725 subject-years), there were 3 cases (0.11 per 100 subject-years) of exacerbation of CD, 2 cases (0.08 per 100 subject-years) of exacerbation of UC, and 2 cases (0.08 per 100 subject-years) of new onset UC. There were no IBD cases in placebo-treated subjects (N = 793; 176 subject-years) during the 12-week placebo-controlled period. One case of exacerbation of Crohn’s disease in a subject treated with COSENTYX subject was reported in open-label portions of clinical trials in PsO. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects with PsO The safety of COSENTYX was assessed in two Phase 3 trials in pediatric subjects with PsO. The first was a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled, 236-week trial (Trial PsO8) that enrolled 162 pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older, with severe PsO (defined by PASI score ≥ 20, an IGA modified 2011 score of 4, and involving ≥ 10% of the body surface area [BSA]) who were candidates for systemic therapy. The 162 subjects were randomized to receive placebo, a biologic active control, or COSENTYX. In the COSENTYX groups, subjects with body weight (BW) less than 25 kg received 75 mg, subjects with BW 25 to less than 50 kg received either 75 mg or 150 mg (2 times the recommended dose), and subjects with BW of at least 50 kg received either 150 mg or 300 mg (2 times the recommended dose). Subjects were dosed at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter. The second trial was a randomized, open-label, 208-week trial (Trial PsO9; NCT03668613) of 84 pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe PsO (defined by a PASI score ≥ 12, IGA mod 2011 score of ≥ 3, and BSA involvement of ≥ 10% at randomization) who were randomized into two COSENTYX arms [Arm 1: 75 mg for BW < 50 kg or 150 mg for ≥ 50 kg; and Arm 2: 75 mg for BW < 25 kg, 150 mg for BW ≥ 25 kg and < 50 kg, or 300 mg for BW ≥ 50 kg]. Subjects were dosed at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter. The safety profile of COSENTYX reported in these trials was consistent with the safety profile reported in adult PsO trials. Infections One case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) toxic shock syndrome (TSS) was reported in a COSENTYX treated pediatric subject during the placebo-controlled period. In the pediatric safety pool, which includes all subjects who took at least one dose of COSENTYX during the treatment periods [198 subjects (287 subject-years)], 22 (11%) subjects reported ≥ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 2 neutropenia (≥ 1,000 to < 1,500 cells/mm 3 ) with 57% of subjects followed for one year or more and 30% of subjects followed for two years or more. During the placebo-controlled period, which included a total of 80 pediatric subjects treated with COSENTYX and 41 subjects treated with placebo up to 12 weeks, ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 neutropenia was reported in 3 (4%) of the subjects treated with COSENTYX compared with no subjects treated with placebo. No serious infections were associated with cases of neutropenia. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults with PsA COSENTYX was studied in two placebo-controlled PsA trials with 1,003 adult patients (703 patients on COSENTYX and 300 patients on placebo). Of the 703 patients who received COSENTYX, 299 patients received a subcutaneous loading dose of COSENTYX (PsA1) and 404 patients received an intravenous loading dose of secukinumab (PsA2) followed by COSENTYX administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. During the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the trials in patients with PsA, the overall proportion of patients with adverse events was similar in the secukinumab and placebo-treatment groups (59% and 58%, respectively). The adverse events that occurred at a proportion of at least 2% and at a higher proportion in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo groups during the 16-week placebo-controlled period were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nausea, and hypercholesterolemia. The safety profile observed in adult patients with PsA treated with COSENTYX is consistent with the safety profile in the PsO trials in adults. Similar to the clinical trials in patients with PsO, there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the COSENTYX groups (29%) compared to placebo group (26%). There were cases of CD and UC in the secukinumab group that included patients who experienced either exacerbations or the development of new disease. There were three cases of IBD, of which two patients received secukinumab and one received placebo. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults with AS COSENTYX was studied in two placebo-controlled AS trials with 590 adult patients (394 patients on COSENTYX and 196 patients on placebo). Of the 394 patients who received COSENTYX, 145 patients received a subcutaneous load of COSENTYX (study AS1), and 249 received an intravenous loading dose of secukinumab (study AS2) followed by COSENTYX administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. During the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the trials in patients with AS, the overall proportion of patients with adverse events was higher in the secukinumab groups than the placebo-treatment groups (66% and 59%, respectively). The adverse events that occurred at a proportion of at least 2% and at a higher proportion in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo groups during the 16-week placebo-controlled period were nasopharyngitis, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection. The safety profile observed in patients with AS treated with COSENTYX is consistent with the safety profile in PsO clinical trials. In a third controlled trial of AS (study AS3), the safety profile of the 300 mg dose of COSENTYX was consistent with the safety profile of the 150 mg dose of COSENTYX. Similar to clinical trials in patients with PsO, there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the COSENTYX groups (31%) compared to the placebo group (18%). In the original AS program, with 571 patients exposed to COSENTYX, there were 8 cases of IBD during the entire treatment period [5 cases of Crohn’s (0.7 per 100 patient-years) and 3 cases of UC (0.4 per 100 patient-years)]. During the placebo-controlled 16-week period, there were 2 Crohn’s disease exacerbations and 1 new onset UC case that was a serious adverse event in patients treated with COSENTYX compared to none of the patients treated with placebo. During the remainder of the trial when all patients received COSENTYX, 1 patient developed Crohn’s disease, 2 patients had Crohn’s exacerbations, 1 patient developed UC, and 1 patient had an UC exacerbation. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults with nr-axSpA COSENTYX was studied in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled nr-axSpA trial with 555 adult patients (185 patients received a loading COSENTYX dose, 184 patients did not receive a loading COSENTYX dose, and 186 patients received placebo). The safety profile for patients with nr-axSpA treated with COSENTYX was overall similar to the safety profile seen in patients with AS and other previous experience with COSENTYX. Patients in nr-axSpA1 trial who received the loading dosing regimen compared to those without the loading regimen, had higher incidence of infections and infestations (92 per 100 patient-years versus 72 per 100 patient-years), including nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection, and gastrointestinal disorders (27 per 100 patient-years versus 22 per 100 patient-years), including gastritis, lower abdominal pain, colitis, diarrhea, and hematochezia. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients with Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis (JPsA) and ERA COSENTYX was studied in one double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven, randomized trial in 86 pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years old with JPsA and ERA. The safety profile reported in this trial was consistent with the safety profile of secukinumab. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults with HS COSENTYX was studied in two 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled HS trials with 1,084 adult subjects (361 subjects received COSENTYX 300 mg every 2 weeks, 360 subjects received COSENTYX 300 mg every 4 weeks, and 363 subjects received placebo) with a total of 901 subject-years of COSENTYX exposure (the median duration of exposure for subjects treated with COSENTYX was 360 days). The safety profile of COSENTYX observed in these HS trials was consistent with the known safety profile of COSENTYX observed in the PsO trials. Infections During the 16-week placebo-controlled period, subjects who received COSENTYX 300 mg every 2 weeks had the highest incidence of fungal infections (5.3%), compared to subjects who received COSENTYX 300 mg every 4 weeks (4.2%) and subjects who received placebo (2.8%). With longer exposure, the rate of fungal infections remained higher for subjects who received COSENTYX 300 mg every 2 weeks (14.7/100 subject-years) compared to subjects who received COSENTYX 300 mg every 4 weeks (10.1/100 subject-years). The majority of the cases were reported as non-serious, non-severe, and resolved with anti-fungal treatment. Inflammatory Bowel Disease In the open-labeled portion of HS clinical trials, five (0.7%) IBD adverse reactions were reported, all of which were serious and led to withdrawal of trial drug, and occurred only in subjects treated with COSENTYX 300 mg every 2 weeks. There were no IBD cases in subjects treated with COSENTYX 300 mg every 4 weeks. Adverse Reactions of Intravenous COSENTYX The safety of intravenous COSENTYX is based on the pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established safety of subcutaneous COSENTYX in PsA, AS and nr-axSpA patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of COSENTYX. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders : anaphylaxis, angioedema, systemic vasculitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : eczematous eruptions (atopic dermatitis-like eruptions, dyshidrotic eczema, and erythroderma), cutaneous vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum Infections : bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections, including esophageal candidiasis, tracheobronchial candidiasis, cutaneous aspergillosis, cytomegalovirus gastroenteritis/colitis, herpes simplex encephalitis, herpes simplex keratitis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, Hepatitis B virus reactivation, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis"

Before subcutaneous injection, remove COSENTYX from the refrigerator and allow COSENTYX to reach room temperature (15 to 30 minutes for the Sensoready pen, the 150 mg/mL and 75 mg/0.5 mL prefilled syringes; 30 to 45 minutes for the UnoReady pen and the 300 mg/2 mL prefilled syringe) without removing the needle cap. The removable cap of the COSENTYX 150 mg/mL Sensoready pen and the COSENTYX prefilled syringes (150 mg/mL, 75 mg/0.5 mL) contain natural rubber latex and should not be handled by latex-sensitive individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Inspect COSENTYX visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. COSENTYX injection is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if the liquid contains visible particles, is discolored or cloudy. Discard any unused product. 2.11 Preparation and Administration of COSENTYX for Intravenous Use COSENTYX (for intravenous use) must be diluted prior to infusion. Using aseptic technique, prepare COSENTYX (for intravenous use) as follows: Step 1. Volume Calculation Calculate the total volume of COSENTYX for intravenous use solution (in mL) required based on the patient’s actual body weight as follows: Loading dose (6 mg/kg) is 0.24 mL/kg Maintenance dose (1.75 mg/kg) is 0.07 mL/kg Use the number of vials based on total volume needed (one vial contains 5 mL of COSENTYX solution). Step 2. Dilution Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulates or discolorations are noted. Follow Table 1 for recommended infusion bag size based on patient's body weight. Table 1: Recommended Infusion Bags for Dilution and Preparation of COSENTYX for Intravenous Use Based on Body Weight and Dose * If a 50 mL infusion bag is unavailable, then use a 100 mL infusion bag and withdraw and discard 50 mL of saline using aseptic technique and continue to follow the preparation and administration steps. Body weight at time of dosing For the loading dose (6 mg/kg) recommended infusion bag For maintenance dose (1.75 mg/kg) recommended infusion bag Greater than 52 kg 100 mL 100 mL Less than or equal to 52 kg 100 mL 50 mL * From the infusion bag, withdraw and discard a volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, equal to the calculated volume of the COSENTYX solution required for the patient’s dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.6, 2.7)] . From the vial(s), withdraw the calculated volume (mL) of COSENTYX solution and add slowly into the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP infusion bag. To mix the solution, gently invert the bag to avoid foaming. Do not shake. Discard unused COSENTYX product in vials because it does not contain preservatives. Allow the diluted COSENTYX solution for infusion to warm to room temperature prior to the start of the intravenous infusion. Administer the diluted COSENTYX solution for infusion as soon as possible. If not administered immediately, store the diluted solution either: At room temperature 20ºC to 25ºC (68ºF to 77ºF) for no more than 4.5 hours from the start of the preparation (piercing the first vial) to the completion of infusion. Under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no more than 24 hours, from the start of the time of the preparation (piercing the first vial) to the completion of infusion. This time includes the refrigeration of the diluted solution and the time to allow the diluted solution to warm to room temperature. Protect the diluted solution from light during storage under refrigeration. Step 3. Administration Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Administer the infusion at a flow rate of about 3.3 mL/minute for a 100 mL bag or 1.7 mL/min for a 50 mL bag (total administration time: 30 minutes). When administration is complete, flush the line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to guarantee that all the COSENTYX solution for infusion in the line has been administered. Do not infuse COSENTYX concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other drugs. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the IV coadministration of COSENTYX with other drugs."

Adult Plaque Psoriasis Weeks 0 to 12 : Three placebo-controlled trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis were integrated to evaluate the safety of TALTZ compared to placebo for up to 12 weeks. A total of 1167 subjects (mean age 45 years; 66% men; 94% White) with plaque psoriasis received TALTZ (160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W] for 12 weeks) subcutaneously. In two of the trials, the safety of TALTZ (use up to 12 weeks) was also compared with an active comparator, U.S. approved etanercept [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In the 12-week, placebo-controlled period, adverse events occurred in 58% of the TALTZ Q2W group (2.5 per subject-year of follow-up) compared with 47% of the placebo group (2.1 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious adverse events occurred in 2% of the TALTZ group (0.07 per subject-year of follow-up), and in 2% of the placebo group (0.07 per subject-year of follow-up). Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the TALTZ group than in the placebo group during the 12-week placebo-controlled period of the pooled clinical trials. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of the TALTZ Group and More Frequently than in the Placebo Group in the Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Trials through Week 12 a Upper respiratory tract infections cluster includes nasopharyngitis and rhinovirus infection. b U.S. approved etanercept. Adverse Reactions TALTZ 80 mg Q2W (N=1167) n (%) Etanercept b (N=287) n (%) Placebo (N=791) n (%) Injection site reactions 196 (17) 32 (11) 26 (3) Upper respiratory tract infections a 163 (14) 23 (8) 101 (13) Nausea 23 (2) 1 (<1) 5 (1) Tinea infections 17 (2) 0 1 (<1) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the TALTZ group and more frequently than in the placebo group during the 12-week induction period included rhinitis, oral candidiasis, urticaria, influenza, conjunctivitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and angioedema. Weeks 13 to 60 : A total of 332 subjects received the recommended maintenance regimen of TALTZ 80 mg dosed every 4 weeks. During the maintenance period (Weeks 13 to 60), adverse events occurred in 80% of subjects treated with TALTZ (1.0 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 58% of subjects treated with placebo (1.1 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious adverse events were reported in 4% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.05 per subject-year of follow-up) and none in the subjects treated with placebo. Weeks 0 to 60 : Over the entire treatment period (Weeks 0 to 60), adverse events were reported in 67% of subjects treated with TALTZ (1.4 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 48% of subjects treated with placebo (2.0 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious adverse events were reported in 3% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.06 per subject-year of follow-up), and in 2% of subjects treated with placebo (0.06 per subject-year of follow-up). Specific Adverse Drug Reactions Injection Site Reactions The most frequent injection site reactions were erythema and pain. Most injection site reactions were mild-to-moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of TALTZ. Infections In the 12-week, placebo-controlled period of the clinical trials in plaque psoriasis, infections occurred in 27% of subjects treated with TALTZ (1.2 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 23% of subjects treated with placebo (1.0 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.4% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up) and in 0.4% of subjects treated with placebo (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . During the maintenance treatment period (Weeks 13 to 60), infections occurred in 57% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.70 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 32% of subjects treated with placebo (0.61 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.9% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.01 per subject-year of follow-up) and none in the subjects treated with placebo. Over the entire treatment period (Weeks 0 to 60), infections were reported in 38% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.83 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 23% of subjects treated with placebo (1.0 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.7% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up), and in 0.4% of subject treated with placebo (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up). Inflammatory Bowel Disease In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the TALTZ 80 mg Q2W group (Crohn's disease 0.1%, ulcerative colitis 0.2%) than the placebo group (0%) during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period in clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Laboratory Assessment of Cytopenia Neutropenia Over the entire treatment period (Weeks 0 to 60), neutropenia occurred in 11% of subjects treated with TALTZ (0.24 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 3% of subjects treated with placebo (0.14 per subject-year of follow-up). In subjects treated with TALTZ, the incidence rate of neutropenia during Weeks 13 to 60 was lower than the incidence rate during Weeks 0 to 12. In the 12-week, placebo-controlled period, neutropenia ≥ Grade 3 (<1,000 cells/mm 3 ) occurred in 0.2% of the TALTZ group (0.007 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 0.1% of the placebo group (0.006 per subject-year of follow-up). The majority of cases of neutropenia were either Grade 2 (2% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 0.3% for placebo; ≥1,000 to <1,500 cells/mm 3 ) or Grade 1 (7% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 3% for placebo; ≥1,500 cells/mm 3 to ˂2,000 cells/mm 3 ). Neutropenia in the TALTZ group was not associated with an increased rate of infection compared to the placebo group. Thrombocytopenia Ninety eight percent of cases of thrombocytopenia were Grade 1 (3% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W versus 1% for placebo; ≥75,000 cells/mm 3 to <150,000 cells/mm 3 ). Thrombocytopenia in subjects treated with TALTZ was not associated with an increased rate of bleeding compared to subjects treated with placebo. Active Comparator Trials In the two clinical trials that included an active comparator, the rate of serious adverse events during weeks zero to twelve was 0.7% for U.S. approved etanercept and 2% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W, and the rate of discontinuation from adverse events was 0.7% for U.S. approved etanercept and 2% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W. The incidence of infections was 18% for U.S. approved etanercept and 26% for TALTZ 80 mg Q2W. The rate of serious infections was 0.3% for both TALTZ 80 mg Q2W and U.S. approved etanercept. Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis TALTZ was evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial in pediatric subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis 6 to less than 18 years of age. A total of 171 subjects were studied (115 subjects on TALTZ and 56 subjects on placebo). Overall, the safety profile observed in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis treated with TALTZ every 4 weeks is consistent with the safety profile in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of conjunctivitis (2.6%), influenza (1.7%), and urticaria (1.7%). In this clinical trial, Crohn's disease occurred at a greater frequency in the TALTZ group (0.9%) than the placebo group (0%) during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period. Crohn's disease occurred in a total of 4 TALTZ treated subjects (2.0%) in the clinical trial [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Psoriatic Arthritis TALTZ was studied in two placebo-controlled trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis. A total of 678 patients were studied (454 patients on TALTZ and 224 on placebo). A total of 229 patients in these trials received TALTZ 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with TALTZ Q4W is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of influenza (1.3%) and conjunctivitis (1.3%). Ankylosing Spondylitis TALTZ was studied in two placebo-controlled trials in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. A total of 566 patients were studied (376 patients on TALTZ and 190 on placebo). A total of 195 patients in these trials received TALTZ 80 or 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with TALTZ Q4W is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis. In adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred in 2 patients (1.0%) and 1 patient (0.5%), respectively, in the TALTZ 80 mg Q4W group and 1 patient (0.5%) and 0%, respectively, in the placebo group during the 16-week, placebo-controlled period in clinical trials. Of these patients, serious events occurred in 1 patient in the TALTZ 80 mg Q4W group and 1 patient in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis TALTZ was studied in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. A total of 303 patients were studied (198 patients on TALTZ and 105 on placebo). A total of 96 patients in this trial received TALTZ 80 or 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis treated with TALTZ 80 mg Q4W up to Week 16 is consistent with the previous experience of TALTZ in other indications. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins there is the potential for immunogenicity with TALTZ. The assay to test for neutralizing antibodies has limitations detecting neutralizing antibodies in the presence of ixekizumab; therefore, the incidence of neutralizing antibodies development could be underestimated. Plaque Psoriasis Population By Week 12, approximately 9% of adult subjects treated with TALTZ every 2 weeks developed antibodies to ixekizumab. Approximately 22% of subjects treated with TALTZ at the recommended dosing regimen developed antibodies to ixekizumab during the 60-week treatment period. The clinical effects of antibodies to ixekizumab are dependent on the antibody titer; higher antibody titers were associated with decreasing drug concentration and clinical response. Of the adult subjects who developed antibodies to ixekizumab during the 60-week treatment period, approximately 10%, which equates to 2% of subjects treated with TALTZ at the recommended dosing regimen, had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Neutralizing antibodies were associated with reduced drug concentrations and loss of efficacy. In pediatric psoriasis subjects treated with ixekizumab at the recommended dosing regimen up to 12 weeks, 21 subjects (18%) developed anti-drug antibodies, 5 subjects (4%) had confirmed neutralizing antibodies associated with low drug concentrations. No conclusive evidence could be obtained on the potential association of neutralizing antibodies and clinical response and/or adverse events due to small number of pediatric subjects in the study. Psoriatic Arthritis Population For subjects treated with TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks (PsA1), 11% developed anti-drug antibodies, and 8% had confirmed neutralizing antibodies. Ankylosing Spondylitis Population For patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks (AS1, AS2), 5.2% developed anti-drug antibodies, and 1.5% had neutralizing antibodies. Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis Population Of patients treated with TALTZ 80 mg every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks (nr-axSpA1), 8.9% developed anti-drug antibodies, all of which were low titer. No patient had neutralizing antibodies. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to TALTZ across indications or with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TALTZ. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TALTZ exposure. Immune system disorders: anaphylaxis [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Infections: bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections, including cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, esophageal and disseminated mucocutaneous candidiasis, pulmonary tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, varicella zoster virus reactivation, cytomegalovirus colitis, pulmonary aspergillosis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Eczematous eruptions (erythroderma, atopic dermatitis-like eruptions, and dyshidrotic eczema)."

Adult patients may self-inject or caregivers may give injections of TALTZ after training in subcutaneous injection technique using the autoinjector or prefilled syringe. Safety and effectiveness of pediatric self-administration has not been established. Therefore, TALTZ should be administered to pediatric patients by a healthcare provider or by a caregiver who has received training and demonstrated proper subcutaneous injection technique. TALTZ 20 mg and 40 mg doses prepared from the TALTZ 80 mg/mL prefilled syringe should only be administered by a qualified healthcare professional [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 )] . The TALTZ “Instructions for Use” contains more detailed instructions on the preparation and administration of TALTZ [see Instructions for Use] . Before injection, remove TALTZ autoinjector or TALTZ prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow TALTZ to reach room temperature (30 minutes) without removing the needle cap. Inspect TALTZ visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. TALTZ is a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if the liquid contains visible particles, is discolored or cloudy (other than clear and colorless to slightly yellow). Administer each injection at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, thighs or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated or affected by psoriasis. Administration of TALTZ in the upper, outer arm may be performed by a caregiver or healthcare provider [see Instructions for Use] . TALTZ does not contain preservatives, therefore discard any unused product. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. 2.8 Alternative Preparation Instructions of TALTZ Doses for Pediatric Patients with Plaque Psoriasis Weighing 50 kg or Less If the 20 mg/0.25 mL or 40 mg/0.5 mL prefilled syringe is unavailable, TALTZ doses of 20 mg or 40 mg for pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] must be manually prepared according to the steps below using only the TALTZ 80 mg/mL prefilled syringe. The preparation and administration of the 20 mg and 40 mg doses should only be performed by a qualified healthcare professional. For additional preparation and administration instructions, [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Gather the following necessary supplies for preparation: 0.5 mL or 1 mL disposable syringe Sterile needle for withdrawal 27-gauge sterile needle for administration Sterile, clear glass vial. Expel the entire contents of the prefilled syringe into the sterile vial. DO NOT shake or swirl the vial. Do not add other medications to solutions containing TALTZ. Using the 0.5 mL or 1 mL disposable syringe and sterile needle, withdraw the prescribed dose from the vial (0.25 mL for 20 mg; 0.5 mL for 40 mg). Remove the needle from the syringe and replace it with a 27-gauge needle prior to administering TALTZ. Storage of Prepared TALTZ If necessary, TALTZ 20 mg or 40 mg doses prepared from an 80 mg/mL prefilled syringe may be stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours from first puncturing the sterile vial."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bausch Health US, LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The overall safety population included 4,558 subjects (3,066 SILIQ, 613 ustekinumab, 879 placebo) in controlled clinical trials and open-label extension studies. The majority of subjects were male (69%), white (91%), and aged 40-64 years old (58%). One third of subjects reported previous biologic use prior to enrollment. Across the clinical development program, 4,464 subjects received at least one dose of SILIQ; 3,755 subjects were exposed to SILIQ for at least 1 year. Weeks 0 to 12: Data from one multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Trial 1), two multicenter, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled trials (Trials 2 and 3), and one dose-finding trial (Trial 4) in plaque psoriasis were pooled to evaluate the safety of SILIQ (210 mg weekly at Weeks 0, 1, and 2, followed by treatments every 2 weeks [Q2W]) compared to placebo for up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation. During the 12-week, randomized treatment period, about 1% of the subjects in the treatment groups (SILIQ, ustekinumab, and placebo) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of SILIQ included neutropenia, arthralgia, and urticaria. The proportion of subjects who developed serious adverse events was similar among the SILIQ, ustekinumab, and placebo groups. Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the SILIQ 210 mg Q2W group than in the placebo group during the 12-week randomized treatment period of the pooled trials.

Week 0 to End of Trial: Through Week 52, exposure-adjusted rates of serious adverse events were similar between subjects treated with SILIQ and those treated with ustekinumab. Through the end of the trial, the exposure-adjusted rates of treatment-emergent serious adverse events were similar to those seen in the 52-week period in the subjects treated with SILIQ. Specific Adverse Reactions: Suicidal Ideation and Behavior During the 12-week randomized treatment period in the pooled trials, one subject in the SILIQ group attempted suicide and none in the placebo or ustekinumab groups. From initiation through Week 52 of the trials, suicidal ideation or behavior occurred in 7 of 4,019 subjects (0.2 per 100 subject-years) treated with SILIQ and in 2 of 613 subjects (0.4 per 100 subject-years) treated with ustekinumab. During the course of the clinical trials for plaque psoriasis, suicidal ideation or behavior occurred in 34 of 4,464 subjects treated with SILIQ (0.37 per 100 subject-years). Eight of the 10 subjects who attempted or completed suicide had a history of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) ]. Infections During the 12-week randomized treatment period, infections occurred in 25.4% of the SILIQ group compared to 23.4% of the placebo group. The majority of infections consisted of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and influenza, and did not necessitate treatment discontinuation. The SILIQ group had a higher rate of fungal infections compared to the placebo group (1.8% vs 0.9%). The fungal infections were primarily non-serious skin and mucosal candida infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Neutropenia During the 12-week randomized treatment period, neutropenia occurred in 0.7% of subjects in the SILIQ group. Most adverse reactions of neutropenia were transient. In subjects with normal absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at baseline, a reduction in ANC occurred in 6.8% of subjects in the SILIQ group, compared to 3.3% in the ustekinumab group, and 3.6% in the placebo group. Neutropenia ≥ Grade 3 (< 1,000/mm 3 ) occurred in 0.5% of subjects in the SILIQ group compared to 0.2% of subjects in the ustekinumab group and none in the placebo group. From Week 0 to end of trial, the exposure-adjusted rate of treatment-emergent neutropenia was 0.4 per 100 subject-years (0.1 per 100 subject-years were ≥ Grade 3). No serious infections were associated with cases of neutropenia. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity with SILIQ. Approximately 3% of subjects treated with SILIQ developed antibodies to brodalumab through the 52-week treatment period. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to brodalumab, none had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. However, the assay to test for neutralizing antibodies had limitations detecting neutralizing antibodies in the presence of brodalumab; therefore, the incidence of neutralizing antibody development could be underestimated. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to SILIQ with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SILIQ. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, including anaphylactic shock, pruritus, rashes, eczema, urticaria, and dermatitis [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Eczematous eruptions (atopic dermatitis-like eruptions) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer 210 mg of SILIQ by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0, 1, and 2 followed by 210 mg every 2 weeks. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Tuberculosis Assessment Prior to Initiation of SILIQ Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with SILIQ [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. 2.2 Dosage The recommended SILIQ dose is 210 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0, 1, and 2 followed by 210 mg every 2 weeks. If an adequate response has not been achieved after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment with SILIQ, consider discontinuing therapy. Continued treatment beyond 16 weeks in patients who have not achieved an adequate response is not likely to result in greater success. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Administer SILIQ subcutaneously. Each prefilled syringe is for single dose only. Instruct patients to review the Medication Guide before use [see Medication Guide] . SILIQ is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare professional. Patients may self-inject SILIQ when deemed appropriate by a healthcare professional and after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique using the prefilled syringe. Advise patients who are self-administering to inject the full dose and to read the Instructions for Use before administration [ see Instructions for Use] . Do not inject SILIQ into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, or affected by psoriasis. 2.4 Preparation of SILIQ Prefilled Syringe Allow SILIQ prefilled syringe to reach room temperature (approximately 30 minutes) before injecting. Do not warm in any other way. Do not remove the gray needle cap on the prefilled syringe while allowing it to reach room temperature. Visually inspect SILIQ for particles and discoloration prior to administration. SILIQ is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use SILIQ if it is cloudy or discolored or if foreign matter is present. Instruct patients to use the prefilled syringe and to inject the full amount (1.5 mL), which provides 210 mg of SILIQ, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use]."

Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Trials In clinical trials, a total of 1,789 subjects with plaque psoriasis were treated with BIMZELX. Of these, 1,073 subjects were exposed to BIMZELX for at least one year. The safety of BIMZELX was evaluated in two placebo-controlled trials (Ps-1 and Ps-2), an active-controlled trial (Ps-3), and an open-label extension trial. Data from Trials Ps-1 and Ps-2 in 839 subjects (mean age 45 years, 72% male, 84% White) were pooled to evaluate the safety of BIMZELX in comparison to placebo up to 16 weeks after treatment initiation. A total of 670 subjects were treated during this initial period with BIMZELX 320 mg at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of 1% or greater and at a higher rate in the BIMZELX group than the placebo group. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in the BIMZELX Group and More Frequently than in the Placebo Group in Trials Ps-1 and Ps-2 BIMZELX N=670 n (%) Placebo N=169 n (%) URI Upper Respiratory Infections include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, rhinitis, viral upper respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis streptococcal, pharyngitis bacterial, peritonsillar abscess, viral rhinitis, and influenza 102 (15) 24 (14) Oral Candidiasis Oral Candidiasis includes oral candidiasis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, oral fungal infection, fungal pharyngitis, and oropharyngitis fungal 61 (9) 0 (0) Headache 22 (3) 0 (0) Injection Site Reactions Injection Site Reactions include injection site reaction, injection site erythema, injection site pain, injection site edema, injection site bruising, and injection site swelling 19 (3) 2 (1) Tinea Infections Tinea Infections include tinea pedis, fungal skin infection, tinea versicolor, tinea cruris, tinea infection, body tinea, and onychomycosis 18 (3) 1 (1) Gastroenteritis Gastroenteritis includes Enterovirus infection, gastroenteritis, gastroenteritis bacterial, and gastroenteritis viral 12 (2) 0 (0) Herpes Simplex Infections Herpes Simplex Infections include herpes simplex and oral herpes 9 (1) 0 (0) Acne 8 (1) 0 (0) Folliculitis 8 (1) 0 (0) Other Candida Infections Other Candida Infections include vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, skin candida, and genital candidiasis. 7 (1) 1 (1) Fatigue 7 (1) 0 (0) Adverse reactions that occurred in < 1% but > 0.1% of subjects in the BIMZELX group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group through Week 16 were neutropenia, eczema, otitis externa, otitis media, and pyrexia. The safety of BIMZELX was evaluated in another active-controlled trial (Ps-4) in 743 adult subjects who received BIMZELX 320 mg every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks through Week 48. Specific Adverse Reactions Suicidal Ideation and Behavior : The study populations of Trial Ps-1, Trial Ps-2, Trial Ps-3 and Trial Ps-4 excluded subjects with active suicidal ideation, suicidal ideation within the month prior to screening, a history of suicide attempt within the past 5 years prior to screening, or moderately severe to severe major depression (i.e., score of ≥15 on the screening Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)). Analysis of pooled C-SSRS data from the first 16 weeks of placebo-controlled clinical trials indicated that 12/670 (1.8%) BIMZELX-treated subjects and 1/169 (0.6%) subjects receiving placebo reported passive suicidal ideation with an estimated relative risk of 3.0 (95% confidence interval: 0.39, 22.74). Subjects without a prior history of SI/B treated with BIMZELX also reported a higher rate of new onset suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS than subjects receiving placebo (1.3% vs 0.6%). During the course of the clinical trials for plaque psoriasis, there was 1 completed suicide in the open label extension trial after 718 days of treatment (1/2,480; 0.01/100 patient-years). The completed suicide was reported in a subject without a past reported psychiatric history. There were also 3 suicide attempts (3/2,480; 0.04/100 patient-years); 2 of these subjects had a history of prior suicide attempts. Infections : During the placebo-controlled period of Trials Ps-1 and Ps-2, infections were reported in 36% of subjects (141.7 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX compared with 23% of subjects (84.6 per 100 patient-years) receiving placebo. Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of subjects (1.0 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX and 0% subjects receiving placebo . The most common infections were upper respiratory tract infections and Candida infections, including oral candidiasis (oral candidiasis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, oral fungal infection, fungal pharyngitis, and oropharyngitis fungal) occurring in 9% (30.6 per 100 patient-years) of subjects treated with BIMZELX and other Candida infections (vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, skin candida, and genital candidiasis) in 1% (3.4 per 100 patient-years) of subjects treated with BIMZELX compared to 0% and 1%, respectively, of subjects receiving placebo. During the combined initial, maintenance, and open-label extension treatment periods of trials Ps-1, Ps-2, Ps-3, and the open-label extension trial, infections were reported in 63% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (120.4 per 100 patient-years). Serious infections were reported in 1.5% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (1.6 per 100 patient-years). Inflammatory Bowel Disease : In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, subjects with active inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. In these trials, which included 2,480 subjects exposed to BIMZELX accounting for 5,830 patient-years, adjudicated cases of new onset of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD-undetermined) occurred in seven subjects (0.12 per 100 patient-years); the majority of these cases were serious and resulted in discontinuation of therapy. Liver Biochemical Abnormalities : During the placebo-controlled period of Trials Ps-1 and Ps-2, liver serum transaminase elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) occurred in 1.0% of subjects treated with BIMZELX versus 0.6% of subjects receiving placebo. The time to onset of these adverse reactions varied between 28 and 198 days after starting BIMZELX treatment. Elevated liver serum transaminases resolved during continued treatment or after discontinuation of BIMZELX. Safety through Week 56 During the maintenance period (Week 16 through Week 52 of Trial Ps-1 and Week 56 of Trial Ps-2), adverse reactions were consistent with those observed during the initial 16 weeks of treatment with BIMZELX. During the maintenance treatment periods of Trial Ps-2 and Trial Ps-3, the rates of adverse reactions were similar between subjects treated with BIMZELX 320 mg every four week and every eight weeks, after the initial 16 weeks of treatment. Safety through Week 128 During the open-label extension trial, including data from Week 56 through Week 128, new adverse reactions of suicide attempt and a completed suicide occurred [described above in Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ]. Additional Safety Data In an active-controlled clinical trial (Trial Ps-4), 691 subjects with plaque psoriasis were treated with BIMZELX for up to 144 weeks. Adverse reactions were consistent with those observed during the initial 16 weeks of treatment and with the overall safety profile of BIMZELX. Psoriatic Arthritis Clinical Trials The safety of BIMZELX was evaluated in two placebo-controlled trials (PsA-1 and PsA-2). Data from Trials PsA-1 and PsA-2 in 1,111 subjects (mean age 49 years, 47% male, 96% White) were pooled to evaluate the safety of BIMZELX in comparison to placebo up to 16 weeks after treatment initiation. A total of 698 subjects were treated during this initial period with BIMZELX 160 mg at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of 2% or greater and at a higher rate in the BIMZELX group than the placebo group. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥2% of Subjects with Psoriatic Arthritis in the BIMZELX Group and More Frequently than in the Placebo Group in Trials PsA-1 and PsA-2 BIMZELX N=698 n (%) Placebo N=413 n (%) URI Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URI) includes: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and rhinitis. 99 (14) 41 (10) Headache 25 (4) 7 (2) Diarrhea 19 (3) 8 (2) Urinary Tract Infection 14 (2) 7 (2) Oral Candidiasis 16 (2) 0 Adverse reactions that occurred in < 2% but > 1% of subjects in the BIMZELX group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group through Week 16 included neutropenia (placebo: n=0; BIMZELX: n=8 (1.1%)), stomatitis (placebo: n=0; BIMZELX: n=8 (1.1%)), bronchitis (placebo: n=1 (0.2%); BIMZELX: n=11 (1.6%)), and oropharyngeal pain (placebo: n=0; BIMZELX: n=9 (1.3%)). Specific Adverse Reactions Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: The neuropsychiatric inclusion/exclusion criteria in PsA trials were the same as in PSO. Based on a pooled analysis of the first 16 weeks of the placebo controlled clinical trials, 2 of the 698 subjects in the BIMZELX group (0.3%) reported passive suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS compared to 3 of 413 subjects in the placebo group (0.7%). During the entire clinical trial program for PsA (2,664 patient-years), there were 2 cases of suicidal ideation (2/1413; 0.08/100 patient-years) and 1 suicide attempt (1/1413; 0.04/100 patient-years); all reported in BIMZELX-treated subjects with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Infections: During the placebo-controlled period of Trials PsA-1 and PsA-2, infections were reported in 27% of subjects (100.7 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX compared with 18% of subjects (62.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. Serious infections occurred in 0.4% of subjects (1.4 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX and 0% treated with placebo . The most common infections were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection and Candida infections, including oral candidiasis (oral candidiasis, oral fungal infection, and tongue fungal infection), occurring in 3.2% (10.2 per 100 patient-years) of subjects treated with BIMZELX and other Candida infections (skin candida, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvovaginal mycotic infection) in 0.6% (1.8 per 100 patient-years) of subjects treated with BIMZELX compared to 0% and 1%, respectively, of subjects treated with placebo. During the combined placebo-controlled, maintenance and open-label extension treatment periods of Trials PsA-1 and PsA-2, infections were reported in 58% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (58.5 per 100 patients-years). Serious infections were reported in 2% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (1.3 per 100 patient-years). Inflammatory Bowel Disease: In clinical trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis, subjects with active inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. In these trials, which included 1,413 subjects exposed to BIMZELX accounting for 2,664 patient-years, adjudicated cases of new onset of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis (UC) and IBD) occurred in 2 subjects (0.08 per 100 patient-years); one of these cases was serious and none resulted in discontinuation of therapy. Liver Biochemical Abnormalities: During the placebo-controlled period of Trials PsA-1 and PsA-2, liver serum transaminase elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) occurred in 1.3% of subjects treated with BIMZELX versus 0% of subjects receiving placebo. Elevated liver serum transaminases resolved during continued treatment or after discontinuation of BIMZELX. Safety through Week 52 During the maintenance period (Week 16 through Week 52 of Trial PsA-1), adverse reactions were consistent with those observed during the initial 16 weeks of treatment and with the overall safety profile of BIMZELX. Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis Clinical Trials BIMZELX was evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial (Trial nr-axSpA-1) in subjects with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (128 subjects on BIMZELX and 126 subjects on placebo). The safety profile observed in subjects with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis treated with BIMZELX was overall similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with psoriatic arthritis, except for cough, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, tonsilitis, transaminase increase (placebo: n=0; BIMZELX: n=3 (2.3%) for each), and fatigue (placebo: n=1 (0.8%); BIMZELX: n=3 (2.3%)). Specific Adverse Reactions Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: The neuropsychiatric inclusion/exclusion criteria were the same in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis trials as in PSO. During the first 16 weeks of the placebo controlled clinical trial (Trial nr-axSpA-1), no subjects in the BIMZELX or placebo group reported suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS. During the entire clinical trial program for nr-axSpA (398 patient-years), there were no cases of suicidal ideations. One suicide attempt (1/244; 0.25/100 patient-years) was reported in a BIMZELX-treated patient with pre-existing psychiatric conditions and recent life stressors. Infections: During the placebo-controlled period of Trial nr-axSpA-1, infections were reported in 36% of subjects (144.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX compared with 25% of subjects (94.4 per 100 patient-years) receiving placebo. There were no reports of serious infections reported during the placebo-controlled period of the trial. During the combined 52 week treatment period of Trial nr-axSpA-1, and subsequent open-label treatment, infections were reported in 68% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (78.0 per 100 patient-years). Serious infections were reported in 1.6% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (1.0 per 100 patient-years). Inflammatory Bowel Disease: In the clinical trial in subjects with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, subjects with active inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. In placebo-controlled, maintenance, and open label treatment periods of this trial, which included 244 subjects exposed to BIMZELX accounting for 397 patient-years, adjudicated cases of new onset of inflammatory bowel disease occurred in 1 subject (Ulcerative Colitis; 0.26 per 100 patient-years); this case of ulcerative colitis was nonserious and did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Liver Biochemical Abnormalities: During the placebo-controlled period of Trials nr-axSpA-1, liver serum transaminase elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of subjects treated with BIMZELX versus 0.8% of subjects receiving placebo. Elevated liver serum transaminases resolved during continued treatment or after discontinuation of BIMZELX. Safety through Week 52 During the maintenance period (Week 16 through Week 52 of Trial nr-axSpA-1), adverse reactions were consistent with those observed during the initial 16 weeks of treatment and with the overall safety profile of BIMZELX. Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Trials BIMZELX was evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial (Trial AS-1) in subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (221 subjects on BIMZELX and 111 subjects on placebo). The safety profile observed in subjects with ankylosing spondylitis treated with BIMZELX was overall similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with psoriatic arthritis, except for injection site pain, rash (placebo: n=1 (0.9%); BIMZELX: n=6 (2.7%), for each) and vulvovaginal mycotic infection (placebo: n=0; BIMZELX: n=5 (2.3%)). Specific Adverse Reactions Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: The neuropsychiatric inclusion/exclusion criteria were the same in AS trials as in PSO. During the first 16 weeks of the placebo controlled clinical Trial AS-1, no subjects in the BIMZELX or placebo group reported suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS. During the entire clinical trial program for AS (1,844 patient-years), there was 1 case of suicidal ideation (1/684; 0.05/100 patient-years) reported in a subject with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Infections: During the placebo-controlled period of Trial AS-1, infections were reported in 28% of subjects (110.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX compared with 23% of subjects (83.7 per 100 patient-years) receiving placebo. Serious infections occurred in 1 (0.5%) subject (1.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX and 1 (0.9%) subject (2.9 per 100 patient-years) receiving placebo . During the combined 52 week treatment period of Trial AS-1, and subsequent open-label treatment, infections were reported in 62% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (58.8 per 100 patient-years). Serious infections were reported in 2.7% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (1.5 per 100 patient-years). Inflammatory Bowel Disease: In clinical trials in subjects with AS, subjects with active inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. In these phase 2/3 trials, which included 593 subjects exposed to BIMZELX accounting for 1,599 patient-years, adjudicated cases of new onset of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD-undetermined) occurred in 6 subjects (0.38 per 100 patient-years); 4 cases were serious, and 3 cases resulted in discontinuation of therapy. Liver Biochemical Abnormalities: During the placebo-controlled period of Trial AS-1, liver serum transaminase elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) occurred in 1.4% of subjects treated with BIMZELX versus 1.8% of subjects receiving placebo. Elevated liver serum transaminases resolved during continued treatment or after discontinuation of BIMZELX. Safety through Week 52 During the maintenance period (Week 16 through Week 52 of Trial AS-1), adverse reactions were consistent with those observed during the initial 16 weeks of treatment and with the overall safety profile of BIMZELX. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Trials BIMZELX was evaluated in two placebo-controlled trials (Trial HS-1 and Trial HS-2) in 1,007 adult subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (861 BIMZELX-treated subjects and 146 subjects receiving placebo) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The safety profile observed in subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa treated with BIMZELX was overall similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with PSO treated with BIMZELX. Upon completion of both trials, a total of 657 subjects enrolled in a long-term extension treatment period for up to an additional 188 weeks. Specific Adverse Reactions Suicidal Ideation and Behavior : The neuropsychiatric inclusion/exclusion criteria were the same in HS trials as in PSO. Analysis of pooled C-SSRS data from the first 16 weeks of the placebo-controlled clinical trials indicated that 16/861 (1.9%) BIMZELX-treated subjects and 1/146 (0.7%) subjects receiving placebo reported suicidal ideation with an estimated relative risk of 2.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.36, 20.12). Subjects without a prior history of SI/B treated with BIMZELX also reported a higher rate of new-onset suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS than subjects treated with placebo (0.9% vs. 0%). There were 2 reported cases of suicidal ideation that were adjudicated as suicide attempts (2/1,041; 0.15/100 patient-years). Both subjects had a history of neuropsychiatric disorders. Infections: During the placebo-controlled period of Trials HS-1 and HS-2, infections were reported in 33% of subjects (132.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX compared with 21% of subjects (76.4 per 100 patient-years) receiving placebo. Serious infections occurred in 0.1% of subjects (0.4 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX and 0% of subjects receiving placebo . The most commonly reported infections were comparable to those reported in subjects with PSO. Oral candidiasis occurred in 7.8% of subjects (26.7 per 100 patient years) treated with BIMZELX 320 mg Q2W, 3.9% of subjects (12.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX 320 mg Q4W, and 0 subjects receiving placebo. Other candida infections occurred in 3.6% of subjects (12.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX 320 mg Q2W, 6.7% of subjects (22.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX 320 mg Q4W, and 0 subjects receiving placebo. Tinea infections occurred in 3.1% of subjects (10.4 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX 320 mg Q2W, 2.5% of subjects (8.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with BIMZELX 320 mg Q4W, and 0.7% (2.3 per 100 patient-years) receiving placebo. During the combined placebo-controlled, maintenance treatment periods and open-label extension treatment periods of Trials HS-1 and HS-2, infections were reported in 68% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (104.7 per 100 patient-years). Serious infections were reported in 2.1% of subjects treated with BIMZELX (1.7 per 100 patient-years). Inflammatory Bowel Disease: In clinical trials in subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa, subjects with active inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. During the combined placebo-controlled, maintenance, and open-label extension treatment periods of Trials HS-1 and HS-2, which included 995 subjects exposed to BIMZELX accounting for 1,272 patient-years, adjudicated cases of new onset of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and undetermined) occurred in 5 subjects (0.39 per 100 patient-years); 3 of these cases were serious, all of which resulted in discontinuation of therapy. Additionally, flares of pre-existing IBD occurred in 2 subjects, which resulted in discontinuation of BIMZELX in both. Liver Biochemical Abnormalities: During the placebo-controlled period of Trials HS-1 and HS-2, liver serum transaminase elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) occurred in 1.2% of subjects treated with BIMZELX versus 0% of subjects receiving placebo. Elevated liver serum transaminases resolved during continued treatment or after discontinuation of BIMZELX. Safety through Week 48 During the maintenance period (Week 16 through Week 48 of Trials HS-1 and HS-2), adverse reactions were consistent with those observed during the initial 16 weeks of treatment and with the overall safety profile of BIMZELX. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of BIMZELX. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Plaque Psoriasis A total of 2234 subjects were treated with SKYRIZI in clinical development trials in plaque psoriasis. Of these, 1208 subjects with psoriasis were exposed to SKYRIZI for at least one year. Data from placebo- and active-controlled trials were pooled to evaluate the safety of SKYRIZI for up to 16 weeks. In total, 1306 subjects were evaluated in the SKYRIZI 150 mg group. Table 2 summarizes the adverse drug reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the SKYRIZI group than the placebo group during the 16-week controlled period of pooled clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Drug Reactions Occurring in ≥ 1% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis on SKYRIZI through Week 16 Adverse Drug Reactions SKYRIZI N = 1306 n (%) Placebo N = 300 n (%) Upper respiratory infections a 170 (13.0) 29 (9.7) Headache b 46 (3.5) 6 (2.0) Fatigue c 33 (2.5) 3 (1.0) Injection site reactions d 19 (1.5) 3 (1.0) Tinea infections e 15 (1.1) 1 (0.3) a Includes: respiratory tract infection (viral, bacterial or unspecified), sinusitis (including acute), rhinitis, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis (including viral), tonsillitis b Includes: headache, tension headache, sinus headache, cervicogenic headache c Includes: fatigue, asthenia d Includes: injection site bruising, erythema, extravasation, hematoma, hemorrhage, infection, inflammation, irritation, pain, pruritus, reaction, swelling, warmth e Includes: tinea pedis, tinea cruris, body tinea, tinea versicolor, tinea manuum, tinea infection, onychomycosis Adverse drug reactions that occurred in < 1% but > 0.1% of subjects in the SKYRIZI group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group through Week 16 were folliculitis and urticaria. Specific Adverse Drug Reactions Infections In the first 16 weeks, infections occurred in 22.1% of the SKYRIZI group (90.8 events per 100 subject-years) compared with 14.7% of the placebo group (56.5 events per 100 subject-years) and did not lead to discontinuation of SKYRIZI. The rates of serious infections for the SKYRIZI group and the placebo group were ≤0.4%. Serious infections in the SKYRIZI group included cellulitis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and herpes zoster. In Studies PsO-1 and PsO-2, through Week 52, the rate of infections (73.9 events per 100 subject-years) was similar to the rate observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment. Safety T hrough Week 52 Through Week 52, no new adverse reactions were identified, and the rates of the adverse reactions were similar to those observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment. During this period, serious infections that led to study discontinuation included pneumonia. Psoriatic Arthritis The overall safety profile observed in subjects with psoriatic arthritis treated with SKYRIZI is generally consistent with the safety profile in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Additionally, in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials the incidence of hepatic events was higher in the SKYRIZI group (5.4%, 16.7 events per 100 patient years) compared to the placebo group (3.9%, 12.6 events per 100 patient years). Of these, the most common events that were reported more frequently in both the placebo group and the SKYRIZI group were ALT increased (placebo: n=12 (1.7%); SKYRIZI: n=16 (2.3%)), AST increased (placebo: n=9 (1.3%); SKYRIZI: n=13 (1.8%)), and GGT increased (placebo: n=5 (0.7%); SKYRIZI: n=8 (1.1%)). There were no serious hepatic events reported. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was higher in the SKYRIZI group (n=16, 2.3%) compared to the placebo group (n=9, 1.3%). In the Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials, hypersensitivity reactions reported at a higher rate in the SKYRIZI group included rash (placebo: n=4 (0.6%); SKYRIZI: n=5 (0.7%), allergic rhinitis (placebo: n=1 (0.1%); SKYRIZI: n=2 (0.3%), and facial swelling (placebo: n=0 (0.0%); SKYRIZI n=1 (0.1%). One case of anaphylaxis was reported in a subject who received SKYRIZI in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Crohn’s Disease SKYRIZI was studied up to 12 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction studies (CD-1, CD-2) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study (CD-4; NCT02031276). Long-term safety up to 52 weeks was evaluated in subjects who responded to induction therapy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance study (CD-3) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . In the two induction studies (CD-1, CD-2) and the dose finding study (CD-4), 620 subjects received the SKYRIZI intravenous induction regimen at Weeks 0, 4 and 8. In the maintenance study (CD-3), 297 subjects who achieved clinical response, defined as a reduction in CDAI of at least 100 points from baseline after 12 weeks of induction treatment with intravenous SKYRIZI in studies CD-1 and CD-2, received a maintenance regimen of SKYRIZI either 180 mg or 360 mg subcutaneously at Week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter for up to an additional 52 weeks. Adverse reactions reported in > 3% of subjects in induction studies and at a higher rate than placebo are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

In this table, injection site reactions are counted only once per subject for the rate calculations. Specific Adverse Drug Reactions Infections In the maintenance study (CD-3) through Week 52, the rate of infections was 32.3% (50.2 events per 100 subject-years) in subjects who received SKYRIZI 180 mg and 36.6% (60.8 events per 100 subject-years) in subjects who received SKYRIZI 360 mg compared to 36.4% (60.3 events per 100 subject-years) in subjects who received placebo after SKYRIZI induction. The rate of serious infections was 2.6% (2.7 events per 100 subject-years) in subjects who received SKYRIZI 180 mg and 5.6% (7.4 events per 100 subject-years) in subjects who received SKYRIZI 360 mg compared to 2.1% (2.4 events per 100 subject-years) in subjects who received placebo after SKYRIZI induction. Lipid Elevations Elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) were first assessed at 4 weeks following initiation of SKYRIZI in the induction trials (CD-1, CD-2). Increases from baseline and increases relative to placebo were observed at Week 4 and remained stable to Week 12. Following SKYRIZI induction, mean total cholesterol increased by 9.4 mg/dL from baseline to a mean absolute value of 175.1 mg/dL at Week 12. Similarly, mean LDL-C increased by 6.6 mg/dL from baseline to a mean absolute value of 92.6 mg/dL at Week 12. Mean LDL-C increased by 3.1 mg/dL from baseline to a mean absolute value of 99.0 mg/dL at Week 52 with SKYRIZI 180 mg maintenance treatment and by 2.3 mg/dL from baseline to a mean absolute value of 102.2 mg/dL at Week 52 with SKYRIZI 360 mg maintenance treatment (CD-3). Ulcerative Colitis SKYRIZI was studied up to 12 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction study (UC-1) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study (UC-3). Long-term safety up to 52 weeks was evaluated in subjects who responded to induction therapy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance study (UC-2) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )]. In the induction studies (UC-1 and UC-3), 712 subjects received the SKYRIZI 1,200 mg intravenous induction regimen at Weeks 0, 4 and 8. In the maintenance study (UC-2), 347 subjects who achieved clinical response, defined as a decrease in mMS of ≥2 points and ≥30% from baseline and a decrease in RBS ≥1 from baseline or an absolute RBS ≤1, received a maintenance regimen of SKYRIZI either 180 mg or 360 mg subcutaneously at Week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter for up to an additional 52 weeks. The adverse reaction reported in ≥3% subjects treated with SKYRIZI in the ulcerative colitis induction studies (UC-1 and UC-3) and at a higher rate than placebo was arthralgia (3% SKYRIZI vs 1% placebo). Adverse reactions reported in ≥3% of subjects treated with SKYRIZI in the maintenance study (UC-2) and at a higher rate than placebo are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

In this table, injection site reactions are counted only once per subject for the rate calculations. d Includes: rash and rash macular Specific Adverse Drug Reactions The rates of infections, serious infections, and lipid elevations in subjects with UC who received SKYRIZI compared to subjects who received placebo in the induction studies (UC-1 and UC-3) and maintenance study (UC-2) were similar to the rates in subjects with CD who received SKYRIZI compared to subjects who received placebo in the induction studies (CD-1, CD-2, and CD-4) and maintenance study (CD-3). 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products, including other risankizumab products, may be misleading. Plaque Psoriasis By Week 52, approximately 24% (263/1079) of subjects treated with SKYRIZI at the recommended dose developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa, approximately 57% (14% of all subjects treated with SKYRIZI) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Higher antibody titers in approximately 1% of subjects treated with SKYRIZI were associated with lower risankizumab-rzaa concentrations and reduced clinical response. Psoriatic Arthritis By Week 28, approximately 12.1% (79/652) of subjects treated with SKYRIZI at the recommended dose developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa. None of the subjects who developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa were not associated with changes in clinical response for psoriatic arthritis. A higher proportion of subjects with anti-drug antibodies experienced hypersensitivity reactions (6.3% (5/79)) and injection site reactions (2.5% (2/79)) compared to subjects without anti-drug antibodies (3.8% (22/574) with hypersensitivity reactions and 0.7% (4/574) with injection site reactions). None of these hypersensitivity and injection site reactions led to discontinuation of risankizumab-rzaa. Crohn’s D isease By Week 64, antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa developed in approximately 3.4% (2/58) of subjects treated with SKYRIZI induction followed by 360 mg maintenance regimen. No subjects (0/57) treated with SKYRIZI induction followed by 180 mg maintenance regimen developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa. None of the subjects who developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Ulcerative Colitis By Week 64, antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa developed in approximately 8.9% (8/90) or 4.4% (4/91) of subjects treated with SKYRIZI induction followed by the 180 mg or 360 mg maintenance regimen, respectively. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to risankizumab-rzaa, 75% (6.7% of all subjects treated with SKYRIZI induction followed by the 180 mg maintenance regimen) or 50% (2.2% of all subjects treated with SKYRIZI induction followed by the 360 mg maintenance regimen), respectively, had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval of SKYRIZI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to SKYRIZI exposure: Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : eczema and rash"

SKYRIZI may be administered alone or in combination with non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 2. 5 Preparation and Administration Instruction s (Plaque Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis) Administer SKYRIZI 150 mg/mL prefilled pen or prefilled syringe subcutaneously. Patients may self-inject SKYRIZI after training in subcutaneous injection technique. Provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on the subcutaneous injection technique of SKYRIZI. Before injecting, remove the carton with SKYRIZI from the refrigerator and without removing the prefilled pen or prefilled syringe from the carton, allow SKYRIZI to reach room temperature out of direct sunlight (30 to 90 minutes for the prefilled pen and 15 to 30 minutes for the prefilled syringe). Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated or affected by psoriasis. Administration of SKYRIZI in the upper, outer arm may only be performed by a healthcare professional or caregiver. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. The SKYRIZI “Instructions for Use” contains more detailed instructions on the preparation and administration of SKYRIZI [see Instructions for Use ]. Instruct the patient to read the Instructions for Use before administration. 2.6 Recommended Dosage for Crohn’s Disease Adult Patients: Induction The recommended induction dosage of SKYRIZI is 600 mg administered by intravenous infusion over a period of at least one hour at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. Adult Patients: Maintenance The recommended maintenance dosage of SKYRIZI is 180 mg or 360 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at Week 12, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Use the lowest effective dosage needed to maintain therapeutic response. 2.7 Recommended Dosage for Ulcerative Colitis Adult Patients: Induction The recommended induction dosage of SKYRIZI is 1,200 mg administered by intravenous infusion over a period of at least two hours at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8.

If stored refrigerated, allow the diluted SKYRIZI solution in the infusion bag or glass bottle to warm to room temperature prior to the start of the intravenous infusion. 4. Do not administer SKYRIZI diluted solution concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other medicinal products. Handling and Storage of the Vial and the Diluted Solution: Do not shake the vial or diluted solution in the infusion bag or glass bottle. Use the prepared infusion immediately. If not used immediately, store the diluted SKYRIZI solution refrigerated and protected from light for up to 20 hours between 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C). Immediately after preparation or removal from refrigeration, the diluted SKYRIZI solution can be stored at room temperature at up to 77°F (25°C) (protected from sunlight) for up to 8 hours. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 8 hours after dilution in the infusion bag. Exposure to indoor light is acceptable during room temperature storage and administration. Do not freeze. Subcutaneous Maintenance Dosing Regimen: Using the single-dose 180 mg or 360 mg prefilled cartridge with On-Body Injector: SKYRIZI is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare professional. Patients may self-inject SKYRIZI using the on-body injector with prefilled cartridge after training in subcutaneous injection technique. Provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on the subcutaneous injection technique of SKYRIZI. Before using the on-body injector with prefilled cartridge, remove the carton from the refrigerator and allow to reach room temperature out of direct sunlight (45 to 90 minutes) without removing the prefilled cartridge or on-body injector from the carton. Use the on-body injector to administer SKYRIZI 180 mg/1.2 mL or SKYRIZI 360 mg/2.4 mL prefilled cartridge subcutaneously on thigh or abdomen. Start the injection within 5 minutes after inserting the prefilled cartridge into the On-Body Injector. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated or affected by any lesions. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. The SKYRIZI “Instructions for Use” contains more detailed instructions on the preparation and administration of SKYRIZI [see Instructions for Use ] . Instruct the patient to read the Instructions for Use before administration. Using the 90 mg/mL or 180 mg/1.2 mL prefilled syringe: • Administer each SKYRIZI 90 mg/mL or 180 mg/1.2 mL prefilled syringe subcutaneously. • Patients may self-inject SKYRIZI after training in subcutaneous injection technique. Provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on the subcutaneous injection technique of SKYRIZI. • Before injecting, remove the carton from the refrigerator and without removing the prefilled syringes from the carton, allow SKYRIZI to reach room temperature out of direct sunlight (15 to 30 minutes). • Use the 90 mg/mL or 180 mg/1.2 mL prefilled syringe(s) to administer SKYRIZI 180 mg or SKYRIZI 360 mg subcutaneously as follows: ○ 180 mg maintenance dose: ▪ SKYRIZI 90 mg/mL prefilled syringes: Two 90 mg prefilled syringes are required.

( 6.1 ) Ulcerative Colitis (≥3%) : injection site reactions, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infections, headache, gastroenteritis, fatigue, pyrexia, and rash. ( 6.1 ) Crohn's Disease (≥3%) : respiratory tract infections, abdominal pain, injection site reactions, headache, fatigue, arthralgia, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Biotech, Inc. at 1-800-526-7736 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Adults with Plaque Psoriasis In clinical trials, a total of 1823 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis received TREMFYA. Of these, 1393 subjects were exposed to TREMFYA for at least 6 months and 728 subjects were exposed for at least 1 year. Data from two placebo- and active-controlled trials (PsO1 and PsO2) in 1441 subjects (mean age 44 years; 70% males; 82% white) were pooled to evaluate the safety of TREMFYA (100 mg administered subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by every 8 weeks). Weeks 0 to 16: In the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the pooled clinical trials (PsO1 and PsO2), adverse events occurred in 49% of subjects in the TREMFYA group compared to 47% of subjects in the placebo group and 49% of subjects in the U.S. licensed adalimumab group. Serious adverse events occurred in 1.9% of subjects in the TREMFYA group (6.3 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up) compared to 1.4% of subjects in the placebo group (4.7 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up), and in 2.6% of subjects in U.S. licensed adalimumab group (9.9 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up). Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the TREMFYA group than in the placebo group during the 16-week placebo-controlled period. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of Adult Subjects with Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis through Week 16 in Trials PsO1 and PsO2 TREMFYA Subjects receiving 100 mg of TREMFYA at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter 100 mg N=823 n (%) Adalimumab U.S. licensed adalimumab N=196 n (%) Placebo N=422 n (%) Upper respiratory infections Upper respiratory infections include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), pharyngitis, and viral URTI. 118 (14.3) 21 (10.7) 54 (12.8) Headache Headache includes headache and tension headache. 38 (4.6) 2 (1.0) 14 (3.3) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions include injection site erythema, bruising, hematoma, hemorrhage, swelling, edema, pruritus, pain, discoloration, induration, inflammation, and urticaria. 37 (4.5) 15 (7.7) 12 (2.8) Arthralgia 22 (2.7) 4 (2.0) 9 (2.1) Diarrhea 13 (1.6) 3 (1.5) 4 (0.9) Gastroenteritis Gastroenteritis includes gastroenteritis and viral gastroenteritis. 11 (1.3) 4 (2.0) 4 (0.9) Tinea infections Tinea infections include tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea infection, and tinea manuum infections. 9 (1.1) 0 0 Herpes simplex infections Herpes simplex infections include oral herpes, herpes simplex, genital herpes, genital herpes simplex, and nasal herpes simplex. 9 (1.1) 0 2 (0.5) Adverse reactions that occurred in < 1% but > 0.1% of subjects in the TREMFYA group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group through Week 16 in trials PsO1 and PsO2 were migraine, candida infections, and urticaria. Specific Adverse Reactions Infections Infections occurred in 23% of subjects in the TREMFYA group compared to 21% of subjects in the placebo group through 16 weeks of treatment. The most common (≥ 1%) infections that occurred more frequently in the TREMFYA group than in the placebo group were upper respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, tinea infections, and herpes simplex infections; all cases were mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of TREMFYA. The rate of serious infections for the TREMFYA group and the placebo group was ≤ 0.2%. Elevated Liver Enzymes Elevated liver enzymes were reported more frequently in the TREMFYA group (2.6%) than in the placebo group (1.9%). Of the 21 subjects who were reported to have elevated liver enzymes in the TREMFYA group, all events except one were mild to moderate in severity and none of the events led to discontinuation of TREMFYA. Safety through Week 48 Through Week 48, no new adverse reactions were identified with TREMFYA use and the frequency of the adverse reactions was similar to the safety profile observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of TREMFYA was studied in one placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial (PsO5) that included 120 pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The safety profile observed in pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older treated with TREMFYA up to 52 weeks was consistent with the safety profile observed in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Adverse Reactions in Adults with Psoriatic Arthritis TREMFYA was studied in two placebo-controlled trials in adult subjects with psoriatic arthritis (748 subjects on TREMFYA and 372 subjects on placebo). Of the 748 subjects who received TREMFYA, 375 subjects received TREMFYA 100 mg at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter and 373 subjects received TREMFYA 100 mg every 4 weeks. The overall safety profile observed in adult subjects with psoriatic arthritis treated with TREMFYA is generally consistent with the safety profile in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis with the addition of bronchitis and neutrophil count decreased. In the 24-week placebo-controlled period, combined across the two studies, bronchitis occurred in 1.6% of subjects in the TREMFYA q8w group and 2.9% of subjects in the TREMFYA q4w group compared to 1.1% of subjects in the placebo group. Neutrophil count decreased occurred in 0.3% of subjects in the TREMFYA q8w and 1.6% of subjects in the TREMFYA q4w group compared to 0% of subjects in the placebo group. The majority of events of neutrophil count decreased were mild, transient, not associated with infection and did not lead to discontinuation. A similar risk of infection and serious infections was seen in placebo-controlled trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis as in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Adverse Reactions in Adults with Ulcerative Colitis TREMFYA was studied up to 12 weeks in adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction trial (UC1) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, induction dose-finding trial (UC3; NCT04033445). Long-term safety up to 44 weeks was evaluated in subjects who responded to induction therapy in trials UC1 or UC3 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance trial (UC2). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (UC4), subjects received subcutaneous TREMFYA at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by one of two recommended subcutaneous TREMFYA dosing regimens for a total duration of up to 24 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Trials UC1, UC2 and UC3 In the induction trials (UC1 and UC3), 522 subjects received at least one dose of the TREMFYA intravenous induction regimen (i.e., 200 mg at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8). Clinical response was defined as a decrease in modified Mayo score (mMS) of ≥30% and ≥2 points from baseline with either a ≥1 decrease from baseline in rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) or RBS of 0 or 1. In the maintenance trial (UC2), subjects who achieved clinical response after 12 weeks of TREMFYA intravenous induction treatment were randomized and received either TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 4 of trial UC2) or TREMFYA 200 mg every 4 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 0 of trial UC2), by subcutaneous (SC) injection for up to an additional 44 weeks. Respiratory tract infections occurred in ≥2% of subjects treated with TREMFYA and at a higher rate than placebo (8.8% TREMFYA-treated subjects vs. 7.3% placebo-treated subjects) through Week 12 in the induction trials (UC1 and UC3). Respiratory tract infections included COVID-19, influenza, nasopharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and viral respiratory tract infection. Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥3% of subjects treated with TREMFYA and at a higher rate than placebo through Week 44 in the maintenance trial (UC2) are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥3% of Adult Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis through Week 44 in Trial UC2 TREMFYA Subjects receiving TREMFYA 100 mg at Week 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter or TREMFYA 200 mg at Week 12 and every 4 weeks thereafter. 100 mg Subcutaneous Injection N=186 n (%) TREMFYA 200 mg Subcutaneous Injection N=190 n (%) Placebo N=192 n (%) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions include administration site pain, injection site hematoma, injection site hemorrhage, injection site hypersensitivity, injection site erythema, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site rash, injection site reaction, and injection site urticaria. 2 (1.1) 17 (8.9) TREMFYA 200 mg was administered as two 100 mg injections. 2 (1) Arthralgia 8 (4.3) 15 (7.9) 13 (6.8) Upper respiratory tract infection 6 (3.2) 13 (6.8) 8 (4.2) Trial UC4 In trial UC4, 418 subjects were enrolled, of whom 279 subjects were randomized to receive TREMFYA.

In the 24-week trial (UC4), serious infections occurred in 1.8% of subjects treated with TREMFYA versus 0.7% of subjects in the placebo group. Adverse Reactions in Adults with Crohn's Disease TREMFYA was studied in four clinical trials in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (CD1, CD2) and one randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging trial (CD4, NCT03466411); subjects received intravenous TREMFYA at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by one of two recommended subcutaneous TREMFYA dosing regimens for a total duration of up to 48 weeks. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (CD3); subjects received subcutaneous TREMFYA at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by one of two recommended subcutaneous TREMFYA dosing regimens for a total duration of up to 48 weeks. Trials CD1, CD2, and CD4 In trials CD1, CD2, and CD4; 1349 subjects were enrolled, of whom 649 were randomized to intravenous TREMFYA 200 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by either subcutaneous TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 16) for up to an additional 32 weeks (from Week 16 through Week 48) or subcutaneous TREMFYA 200 mg every 4 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 12) for up to an additional 36 weeks (from Week 12 through Week 48); and 211 subjects were randomized to receive placebo. Through Week 12 in trials CD1, CD2, and CD4; headache (including headache, migraine, and sinus headache) was reported in ≥3% of subjects treated with intravenous TREMFYA and at a greater rate than placebo (3.4% TREMFYA-treated subjects vs. 1.9% placebo-treated subjects). In TREMFYA-treated subjects in trial CD2, one case of active extrapulmonary TB was reported between Weeks 12–48 and one case of active pulmonary TB was reported after Week 48. Both subjects had negative baseline screenings and resided in TB-endemic regions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . In general, the safety profile in subjects treated with subcutaneous TREMFYA from Week 12 up to Week 48 in these trials was generally similar to that reported with intravenous TREMFYA through Week 12. Trial CD3 In trial CD3, 347 subjects were enrolled, of whom 230 subjects were randomized to receive TREMFYA. Randomization was 1:1:1 to subcutaneous TREMFYA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by subcutaneous TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 16) for up to an additional 32 weeks (from Week 16 through Week 48); subcutaneous TREMFYA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by subcutaneous TREMFYA 200 mg every 4 weeks (with the first dose given at Week 12) for up to an additional 36 weeks (from Week 12 through Week 48); or placebo. Adverse reactions reported in trial CD3 through Week 48 in ≥3% of subjects treated with either subcutaneous TREMFYA dosing regimen and at a higher rate than placebo are shown in Table 4.

Elevated Liver Enzymes Through Week 12 in CD1, CD2, and CD4; ALT ≥5× ULN was reported in 2/645 (0.3%) subjects treated with intravenous TREMFYA 200 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 and 0/211 subjects treated with placebo. These elevations occurred without concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Through Week 48 in CD3, ALT ≥5× ULN was reported in 0/115 subjects treated with subcutaneous TREMFYA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by subcutaneous TREMFYA 100 mg every 8 weeks; 2/115 (1.7%) subjects treated with subcutaneous TREMFYA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by subcutaneous TREMFYA 200 mg every 4 weeks; and 0/117 subjects treated with placebo. These elevations occurred without concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval of TREMFYA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TREMFYA exposure.

Inject into the front of the thighs or the lower abdomen except for the 2 inches around the navel. For the prefilled syringe only, injection can also be given in the back of the upper arms. Before injection, remove TREMFYA from the refrigerator and allow to reach room temperature up to 25 °C (77 °F) (30 minutes) without removing the needle cap. Do not inject TREMFYA into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, or affected by psoriasis [see Instructions for Use ]. The TREMFYA Instructions for Use contains more detailed patient instructions on the preparation and administration of TREMFYA [see Instructions for Use ] . If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. Inspect TREMFYA visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. TREMFYA is a clear and colorless to light yellow solution that may contain small translucent particles. Do not use if the liquid contains large particles, is discolored or cloudy. TREMFYA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the prefilled pen, One-Press injector, or prefilled syringe. 2.6 Preparation and Administration Instructions for Intravenous Infusion (Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease) Preparation Instructions : Withdraw and then discard 20 mL of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection from the 250 mL infusion bag which is equal to the volume of TREMFYA to be added. Withdraw 20 mL of TREMFYA from the vial and add it to the 250 mL intravenous infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection for a final concentration of 0.8 mg/mL. Gently mix the diluted solution. Discard the vial with any remaining solution. Visually inspect the diluted solution for particulate matter and discoloration before infusion. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Do not infuse TREMFYA concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other medicinal products. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Administration Instructions : TREMFYA solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared, and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. TREMFYA does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for one time use in one patient only. Inspect TREMFYA visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. TREMFYA is a clear and colorless to light yellow solution that may contain small translucent particles. Do not use if the liquid contains large particles, is discolored, or is cloudy. Storage of Diluted Solution: The diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25 °C (77 °F) for up to 10 hours. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 10 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag. Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common (≥1%) adverse reactions associated with ILUMYA treatment are upper respiratory infections, injection site reactions, and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Plaque Psoriasis In clinical trials, a total of 1994 subjects with plaque psoriasis were treated with ILUMYA, of which 1083 subjects were treated with ILUMYA 100 mg. Of these, 672 subjects were exposed for at least 12 months, 587 for 18 months, and 469 for 24 months. Data from three placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3) in 705 subjects (mean age 46 years, 71% males, 81% white) were pooled to evaluate the safety of ILUMYA (100 mg administered subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by every 12 weeks [Q12W]) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Placebo-Controlled Period (Weeks 0-16 of Trial 1 and Weeks 0-12 of Trials 2 and 3) Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% and at a higher rate in the ILUMYA group than in the placebo group. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of Subjects in the ILUMYA Group and More Frequently than in the Placebo Group in the Plaque Psoriasis Trials 1, 2, and 3 * Upper respiratory infections include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, viral upper respiratory tract infection, and pharyngitis. †Injection site reactions include injection site urticaria, pruritus, pain, reaction, erythema, inflammation, edema, swelling, bruising, hematoma, and hemorrhage. Adverse Reaction ILUMYA 100 mg (N=705) N (%) Placebo (N=355) N (%) Upper respiratory infections* 98 (14) 41 (12) Injection site reactions † 24 (3) 7 (2) Diarrhea 13 (2) 5 (1) During the placebo-controlled period of Trials 1, 2, and 3, adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% but greater than 0.1% in the ILUMYA group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group included dizziness and pain in extremity. Cases of angioedema and urticaria were reported in ILUMYA-treated subjects in clinical trials . Safety through Week 52/64 Through Week 52 (Trials 1 and 3) and Week 64 (Trial 2), no new adverse reactions were identified with ILUMYA use and the frequency of the adverse reactions was similar to that observed during the placebo-controlled period. Psoriasis of the Scalp The safety of ILUMYA was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Trial 4) in 231 subjects with psoriasis of the scalp [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. No new safety signals were identified through follow-up to Week 72. Psoriasis of the Nail The safety of ILUMYA was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Trial 5) in 99 subjects with psoriasis of the nail [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. No new safety signals were identified through Week 28. 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies. Up to Week 64, approximately 6.5% of subjects treated with ILUMYA 100 mg developed antibodies to tildrakizumab. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to tildrakizumab, approximately 40% (2.5% of all subjects receiving ILUMYA) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Development of neutralizing antibodies to tildrakizumab was associated with lower serum tildrakizumab concentrations and reduced efficacy."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION See the full prescribing information for recommended evaluations and immunizations prior to treatment. ( 2.1 ) Administer by subcutaneous injection. ( 2.2 ) Recommended dosage is 100 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Evaluation and Immunization Prior to Treatment Initiation Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with ILUMYA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Consider completion of all age appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] 2.2 Dosage ILUMYA is administered by subcutaneous injection. The recommended dosage is 100 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Each syringe contains 1 mL of 100 mg/mL tildrakizumab-asmn. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions ILUMYA should only be administered by a healthcare provider. Administer ILUMYA subcutaneously. Each prefilled syringe is for single-dose only. Inject the full amount (1 mL), which provides 100 mg of tildrakizumab per syringe. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regularly scheduled interval. 2.4 Preparation and Administration of ILUMYA Before injection, remove ILUMYA carton from the refrigerator, and let the prefilled syringe (in the ILUMYA carton with the lid closed) sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Follow the instructions on the ILUMYA carton to remove the prefilled syringe correctly, and remove only when ready to inject. Do not pull off the needle cover until you are ready to inject. Inspect ILUMYA visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. ILUMYA is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if the liquid contains visible particles or the syringe is damaged. Air bubbles may be present; there is no need to remove them. Choose an injection site with clear skin and easy access (such as abdomen, thighs, or upper arm). Do not administer 2 inches around the navel or where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated, or affected by psoriasis. Also, do not inject into scars, stretch marks, or blood vessels. While holding the body of the syringe, pull the needle cover straight off (do not twist) and discard. Inject ILUMYA subcutaneously as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Press down the blue plunger until it can go no further. This activates the safety mechanism that will ensure full retraction of the needle after the injection is given. Remove the needle from the skin entirely before letting go of the blue plunger. After the blue plunger is released, the safety lock will draw the needle inside the needle guard. Discard any unused portion. Dispose of used syringe. image-1 image-2 image-3"

Ulcerative Colitis OMVOH was studied up to 12 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction study (UC-1). In subjects who responded to induction therapy in UC-1, long term safety up to 52 weeks was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance study (UC-2) and a long-term extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In the induction study (UC-1), 1279 subjects were enrolled of whom 958 received OMVOH 300 mg administered as an intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. In the maintenance study (UC-2), 581 subjects were enrolled of whom 389 received OMVOH 200 mg administered as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of subjects and at a higher frequency than placebo during UC-1.

Serious infections were reported by less than 1% in both groups. Serious infections in the OMVOH group included intestinal sepsis, listeria sepsis, and pneumonia. In the maintenance study (UC-2) through Week 40 (a total of 52 weeks of treatment), infections were reported by 93 (24%) subjects treated with OMVOH 200 mg and 44 (23%) subjects treated with placebo. A case of COVID-19 pneumonia was reported as a serious infection in the OMVOH group. Hepatic Enzyme Elevations In UC-1 through Week 12, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥5X ULN was reported by 1 (0.1%) subject treated with OMVOH 300 mg and 1 (0.3%) subject treated with placebo. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥5X ULN was reported by 2 (0.2%) subjects treated with OMVOH 300 mg and no subject treated with placebo. These elevations have been noted with and without concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. In UC-2 through Week 40 (a total of 52 weeks of treatment), 3 (0.8%) subjects treated with OMVOH 200 mg reported ALT ≥5X ULN and 3 (0.8%) subjects reported AST ≥5X ULN; with or without concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. No subjects treated with placebo experienced similar elevations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Crohn's Disease OMVOH was studied up to 52 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (CD-1). The safety population consisted of 630 subjects who received OMVOH 900 mg administered as an intravenous infusion during induction at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by OMVOH 300 mg administered as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks and 211 subjects who received placebo [see Clinical Trials ( 14.2 )] . Eighty-five of the 211 placebo subjects in the safety population who did not achieve clinical response by patient-reported outcome at Week 12 were switched to blinded induction and maintenance treatment with OMVOH. Observed data from these 85 subjects are included in the placebo cohort up to Week 12 and in the OMVOH cohort after Week 12. In CD-1, OMVOH and placebo-treated subjects had different lengths of exposure, therefore, exposure adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) are also displayed in Table 4 to compare adverse reactions. Common Adverse Reactions Table 4 summarizes the frequencies and EAIRs per 100 person-years (PY) for adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of subjects treated with OMVOH and at a higher frequency than placebo during CD-1. Table 4: Adverse Reactions a in Subjects with Crohn's Disease through Week 52 In a Placebo-Controlled Study (CD-1) Abbreviations: EAIR, exposure-adjusted incidence rate; PY, person-years a Reported in at least 5% of subjects and at a higher frequency than placebo b Following OMVOH 900 mg as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8, subjects received OMVOH 300 mg as a subcutaneous injection at Week 12 and every 4 weeks thereafter for up to an additional 40 weeks. In addition, eighty-five placebo subjects who did not achieve clinical response by patient-reported outcome at Week 12 were switched to blinded induction and maintenance treatment with OMVOH. The observed data after Week 12 from these eighty-five subjects were included in the OMVOH cohort. c EAIRs are per 100 PY. The EAIR per 100 PY can be interpreted as an estimated number of first occurrences of the adverse reaction of interest if 100 subjects were treated for one year. d Upper respiratory tract infections includes related terms (e.g., COVID-19, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infection). e Injection site reactions includes related terms (e.g., erythema, hematoma, induration, pain, pruritus, and reaction at the injection site). f Headache includes related terms (i.e., headache and migraine). g Elevated liver tests include related terms (e.g., ALT increased, AST increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, bilirubin increased, and GGT increased) Adverse Reactions OMVOH b N=715, PY=655 n (%) [EAIR c ] Placebo N=211, PY=120 n (%) [EAIR c ] Upper respiratory tract infections d 199 (28) [37] 47 (22) [47] Injection site reactions e 69 (10) [11] 8 (4) [7] Headache f 45 (6) [7] 9 (4) [8] Arthralgia 44 (6) [7] 11 (5) [10] Elevated liver tests g 36 (5) [6] 8 (4) [7] Hepatic Enzyme Elevations Of the subjects with reported adverse reactions of elevated liver tests ( see Table 4 ), 3 subjects treated with OMVOH reported ALT ≥5X ULN and 2 subjects reported AST ≥5X ULN. Neither subject had a concomitant elevation in total bilirubin. No subjects treated with placebo experienced similar elevations. Less Common Adverse Reactions (<5%) In CD-1 through Week 52, urticaria was reported by 13 (2%, 2 per 100 PY) subjects treated with OMVOH and no subjects treated with placebo. Infections In CD-1 through Week 52, infections were reported by 282 (39%, 58 per 100 PY) subjects treated with OMVOH and 73 (35%, 81 per 100 PY) subjects treated with placebo.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be a clear to opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow to slightly brown solution, and free of visible particles. Do not use OMVOH if it is cloudy or there are visible particles. Prior to intravenous administration, determine the dose needed based on the patient's indication (see Table 1 below). For Crohn's disease, discard 45 mL of the infusion bag prior to adding vial contents. Withdraw the required amount of solution from the vial(s) using a 18 gauge to 21 gauge needle and transfer to an infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection (see Table 1 below). Do not mix with other drugs. Do not dilute or infuse through the same intravenous line with other solutions. Table 1: Intravenous Induction Dose and Volume of Diluent Required Indication Intravenous Induction Dose Number of OMVOH 300mg/15mL vials needed Volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose Injection Ulcerative colitis 300 mg 1 50 mL, 100 mL, or 250 mL Crohn's disease 900 mg 3 100 mL or 250 mL Gently invert the infusion bag to mix the contents. Do not shake the prepared infusion bag. Connect the intravenous administration set (infusion line) to the prepared infusion bag and prime the line. Infuse the diluted solution intravenously over a period of at least 30 minutes for the 300 mg dose; at least 90 minutes for the 900 mg dose. If stored refrigerated, allow the diluted solution in the infusion bag to warm to room temperature prior to the start of the intravenous infusion. At the end of the infusion, flush the line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection. Administer the flush at the same infusion rate as used for OMVOH administration. The time required to flush OMVOH solution from the infusion line is in addition to the minimum 30-minute infusion time. Storage of Diluted Solution Start the infusion immediately after preparation. If not used immediately, store the diluted infusion solution in the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Use the diluted infusion solution within 48 total hours, of which not more than 5 hours are permitted at non-refrigerated temperatures not to exceed 25°C (77°F), starting from the time of vial puncture. Keep drug product away from direct heat or light. Do not freeze the diluted solution in the prepared infusion bag. 2.5 Preparation and Administration Instructions for Subcutaneous Injection OMVOH is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare professional. Patients may self-inject OMVOH after training in subcutaneous injection technique. Provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on the subcutaneous injection technique of OMVOH according to the “Instructions for Use”, included with the packaged product. Before injection, remove OMVOH prefilled pens or OMVOH prefilled syringes from the refrigerator, and leave at room temperature for 45 minutes. Do not shake the prefilled pens or prefilled syringes. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be a clear to opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow to slightly brown solution, and free of visible particles. Do not use OMVOH if it is cloudy, discolored, or there are visible particles. Sites for injection include the abdomen, thigh, and back of the upper arm. Instruct patients to inject in a different location (such as upper arms, thighs or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection. Administration of OMVOH in the back of upper arm may only be performed by another person. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. OMVOH does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product. Do not reuse. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing every 4 weeks."

Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety data reflect exposure to STELARA in 3117 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 2414 exposed for at least 6 months, 1855 exposed for at least one year, 1653 exposed for at least two years, 1569 exposed for at least three years, 1482 exposed for at least four years and 838 exposed for at least five years. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% with higher rates in the STELARA groups during the placebo-controlled period of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 5: Adverse Reactions, Reported by ≥1% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis and at Higher Rates in the STELARA groups through Week 12 in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 STELARA Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects treated 665 664 666 Nasopharyngitis 51 (8%) 56 (8%) 49 (7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 30 (5%) 36 (5%) 28 (4%) Headache 23 (3%) 33 (5%) 32 (5%) Fatigue 14 (2%) 18 (3%) 17 (3%) Back pain 8 (1%) 9 (1%) 14 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 8 (1%) 14 (2%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 7 (1%) 9 (1%) 12 (2%) Pruritus 9 (1%) 10 (2%) 9 (1%) Injection site erythema 3 (<1%) 6 (1%) 13 (2%) Myalgia 4 (1%) 7 (1%) 8 (1%) Depression 3 (<1%) 8 (1%) 4 (1%) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the controlled period of Ps STUDIES 1 and 2 through week 12 included: cellulitis, herpes zoster, diverticulitis, and certain injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage, bruising, and irritation). One case of PRES occurred during clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Infections In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for subjects receiving placebo and 13.4 weeks for STELARA-treated subjects), 27% of STELARA-treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per patient-years of follow-up) compared with 24% of subjects receiving placebo (1.21 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of STELARA-treated subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up) and in 0.4% of subjects receiving placebo (0.02 per patient-year of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 patient-years of exposure, 72.3% of STELARA-treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up). Malignancies In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 patient-years of exposure), 1.7% of STELARA-treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred patient-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of STELARA-treated subjects (0.52 per hundred patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in STELARA-treated subjects during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of trials were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race). 1 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of STELARA was assessed in two trials of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ps STUDY 3 evaluated safety for up to 60 weeks in 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old. Ps STUDY 4 evaluated safety for up to 56 weeks in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old. The safety profile in pediatric subjects was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety of STELARA was assessed in 927 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of STELARA in subjects with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in STELARA-treated subjects when compared with placebo-treated subjects (3% vs. 1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials. Crohn's Disease The safety of STELARA was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received STELARA 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg STELARA every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The overall safety profile of STELARA was consistent with the safety profile seen in the clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. Table 6: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 8 in Trials CD-1 and CD-2 occurring in ≥3% of STELARA-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo STELARA 6 mg/kg single intravenous induction dose N=466 N=470 Vomiting 3% 4% Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%). Table 7: Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 44 in Trial CD-3 occurring in ≥3% of STELARA-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo STELARA 90 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose every 8 weeks N=133 N=131 Nasopharyngitis 8% 11% Injection site erythema 0 5% Vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection 1% 5% Bronchitis 3% 5% Pruritus 2% 4% Urinary tract infection 2% 4% Sinusitis 2% 3% Infections In subjects with Crohn's disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the Crohn's disease clinical trials, 0.2% of STELARA-treated subjects (0.36 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.58 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.2% of STELARA-treated subjects (0.27 events per hundred patient-years) and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis In CD trials, two subjects reported hypersensitivity reactions following STELARA administration. One subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (tightness of the throat, shortness of breath, and flushing) after a single subcutaneous administration (0.1% of subjects receiving subcutaneous STELARA). In addition, one subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with or related to a hypersensitivity reaction (chest discomfort, flushing, urticaria, and increased body temperature) after the initial intravenous STELARA dose (0.08% of subjects receiving intravenous STELARA). These subjects were treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids and in both cases symptoms resolved within an hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Ulcerative Colitis The safety of STELARA was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [IV induction] and UC-2 [SC maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The overall safety profile of STELARA in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of STELARA-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were: Induction (UC-1): nasopharyngitis (7% vs 4%). Maintenance (UC-2): nasopharyngitis (24% vs 20%), headache (10% vs 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs 3%), influenza (6% vs 5%), fever (5% vs. 4%), diarrhea (4% vs 1%), sinusitis (4% vs 1%), fatigue (4% vs 2%), and nausea (3% vs 2%). Infections In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 0.4% of STELARA-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of STELARA-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of subjects receiving placebo (0.40 events per hundred patient-years). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in studies of other ustekinumab products. Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with STELARA in clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies. In clinical trials in subjects with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with STELARA for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of STELARA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to STELARA exposure. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, rash, urticaria), including a fatal case that presented with chest tightness and dyspnea during infusion of the first dose . Infections and infestations: Lower respiratory tract infection (including opportunistic fungal infections and tuberculosis). Neurological disorders: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) . Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Skin reactions : Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, hypersensitivity vasculitis."

STELARA should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient's current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that STELARA be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject or a caregiver may inject STELARA after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use] . The needle cover on the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex). The needle cover should not be handled by persons sensitive to latex. It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. When using the vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 27 gauge, ½ inch needle is recommended. Prior to administration, visually inspect STELARA for particulate matter and discoloration. STELARA is a colorless to light yellow solution and may contain a few small translucent or white particles. Do not use STELARA if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. STELARA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe. 2.5 Preparation and Administration of STELARA 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial for Intravenous Infusion (Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) STELARA solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared, and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Calculate the dose and the number of STELARA vials needed based on patient weight (Table 4). Each 26 mL vial of STELARA contains 130 mg of ustekinumab. Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of STELARA to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of STELARA needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Alternatively, a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be used. Withdraw 26 mL of STELARA from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix. Visually inspect the diluted solution before infusion. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted, the infusion should be completely administered within eight hours of the dilution in the infusion bag. Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Do not infuse STELARA concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. STELARA does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for a one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Storage If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25 °C (77 °F) for up to 7 hours. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 8 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag (cumulative time after preparation including the storage and the infusion period). Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution."

Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety data reflect exposure to ustekinumab in 3117 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 2414 exposed for at least 6 months, 1855 exposed for at least one year, 1653 exposed for at least two years, 1569 exposed for at least three years, 1482 exposed for at least four years and 838 exposed for at least five years. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% with higher rates in the ustekinumab groups during the placebo-controlled period of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 5. Adverse Reactions, Reported by ≥ 1% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis and at Higher Rates in the Ustekinumab groups through Week 12 in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Subjects treated Placebo 665 45 mg 664 90 mg 666 Nasopharyngitis 51 (8%) 56 (8%) 49 (7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 30 (5%) 36 (5%) 28 (4%) Headache 23 (3%) 33 (5%) 32 (5%) Fatigue 14 (2%) 18 (3%) 17 (3%) Back pain 8 (1%) 9 (1%) 14 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 8 (1%) 14 (2%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 7 (1%) 9 (1%) 12 (2%) Pruritus 9 (1%) 10 (2%) 9 (1%) Injection site erythema 3 (< 1%) 6 (1%) 13 (2%) Myalgia 4 (1%) 7 (1%) 8 (1%) Depression 3 (< 1%) 8 (1%) 4 (1%) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the controlled period of Ps STUDIES 1 and 2 through week 12 included: cellulitis, herpes zoster, diverticulitis and certain injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage, bruising, and irritation). One case of PRES occurred during clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Infections In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for subjects receiving placebo and 13.4 weeks for ustekinumab-treated subjects), 27% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per patient-years of follow-up) compared with 24% of subjects receiving placebo (1.21 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up) and in 0.4% of subjects receiving placebo (0.02 per patient-year of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 patient-years of exposure, 72.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per patient-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per patient-years of follow-up). Malignancies In the controlled and non-controlled portions of clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis (median follow-up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 patient-years of exposure), 1.7% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred patient-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.52 per hundred patient-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in ustekinumab-treated subjects during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of trials were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race). 1 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in two trials of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ps STUDY 3 evaluated safety for up to 60 weeks in 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old. Ps STUDY 4 evaluated safety for up to 56 weeks in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11years old. The safety profile in pediatric subjects was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in ustekinumab-treated subjects when compared with placebo-treated subjects (3% vs. 1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials. Crohn's Disease The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received ustekinumab 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab was consistent with the safety profile seen in the clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. Table 6. Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 8 in Trials CD-1 and CD-2 occurring in ≥ 3% of Ustekinumab-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo N = 466 Ustekinumab 6 mg/kg single intravenous induction dose N = 470 Vomiting 3% 4% Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%). Table 7. Common Adverse Reactions Through Week 44 in Trial CD-3 occurring in ≥ 3% of Ustekinumab-Treated Subjects and Higher Than Subjects Receiving Placebo Placebo N = 133 Ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose every 8 weeks N = 131 Nasopharyngitis 8% 11% Injection site erythema 0 5% Vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection 1% 5% Bronchitis 3% 5% Pruritus 2% 4% Urinary tract infection 2% 4% Sinusitis 2% 3% Infections In subjects with Crohn's disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the Crohn's disease clinical trials, 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.36 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.58 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.27 events per hundred patient-years) and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis In CD trials, two subjects reported hypersensitivity reactions following ustekinumab administration. One subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (tightness of the throat, shortness of breath, and flushing) after a single subcutaneous administration (0.1% of subjects receiving subcutaneous ustekinumab). In addition, one subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with or related to a hypersensitivity reaction (chest discomfort, flushing, urticaria, and increased body temperature) after the initial intravenous ustekinumab dose (0.08% of subjects receiving intravenous ustekinumab). These subjects were treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids and in both cases symptoms resolved within an hour. Ulcerative Colitis The safety of ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [IV induction] and UC-2 [SC maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were: Induction (UC-1): nasopharyngitis (7% vs 4%). Maintenance (UC-2): nasopharyngitis (24% vs 20%), headache (10% vs 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs 3%), influenza (6% vs 5%), fever (5% vs 4%), diarrhea (4% vs 1%), sinusitis (4% vs 1%), fatigue (4% vs 2%), and nausea (3% vs 2%). Infections In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 0.4% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of subjects receiving placebo (0.40 events per hundred patient-years). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ustekinumab or of other ustekinumab products. Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with ustekinumab in clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis, the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies. In clinical trials in subjects with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with ustekinumab for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ustekinumab product exposure. Immune system disorders: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), other hypersensitivity reactions (including rash and urticaria). Infections and infestations: Lower respiratory tract infection (including opportunistic fungal infections and tuberculosis). Neurological disorders: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) . Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia . Skin reactions : Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, hypersensitivity vasculitis."

WEZLANA should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient's current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that WEZLANA be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject, or a caregiver may inject WEZLANA after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use] . The needle cap on the prefilled syringe does not contain dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex). It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. When using the vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 27 gauge, ½ inch needle is recommended. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. WEZLANA is a clear to opalescent and colorless to light yellow solution. Do not use WEZLANA if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. WEZLANA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe. 2.5 Preparation and Administration of WEZLANA 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial for Intravenous Infusion (Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) WEZLANA solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Calculate the dose and the number of WEZLANA vials needed based on patient weight (Table 4). Each 26 mL vial of WEZLANA contains 130 mg of ustekinumab-auub. Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of WEZLANA to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of WEZLANA needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Alternatively, a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be used. Withdraw 26 mL of WEZLANA from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix. Visually inspect the diluted solution before infusion. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted, the infusion should be completely administered within eight hours of the dilution in the infusion bag. Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Do not infuse WEZLANA concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. WEZLANA does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for a one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Storage If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) for up to 7 hours. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 8 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag (cumulative time after preparation including the storage and the infusion period). Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution."

Biosimilarity of YESINTEK has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety data reflect exposure to ustekinumab in 3117 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, including 2414 exposed for at least 6 months, 1855 exposed for at least one year, 1653 exposed for at least two years, 1569 exposed for at least three years, 1482 exposed for at least four years and 838 exposed for at least five years. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% with higher rates in the ustekinumab groups during the placebo-controlled period of Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis and at Higher Rates in the ustekinumab groups through Week 12 in Ps STUDY 1 and Ps STUDY 2 Ustekinumab Placebo 45 mg 90 mg Subjects treated 665 664 666 Nasopharyngitis 51 (8%) 56 (8%) 49 (7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 30 (5%) 36 (5%) 28 (4%) Headache 23 (3%) 33 (5%) 32 (5%) Fatigue 14 (2%) 18 (3%) 17 (3%) Back pain 8 (1%) 9 (1%) 14 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 8 (1%) 14 (2%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 7 (1%) 9 (1%) 12 (2%) Pruritus 9 (1%) 10 (2%) 9 (1%) Injection site erythema 3 (<1%) 6 (1%) 13 (2%) Myalgia 4 (1%) 7 (1%) 8 (1%) Depression 3 (<1%) 8 (1%) 4 (1%) Adverse reactions that occurred at rates less than 1% in the controlled period of Ps STUDIES 1 and 2 through week 12 included: cellulitis, herpes zoster, diverticulitis and certain injection site reactions (pain, swelling, pruritus, induration, hemorrhage, bruising, and irritation). One case of PRES occurred during adult plaque psoriasis clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Infections In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis (average follow-up of 12.6 weeks for placebo-treated subjects and 13.4 weeks for ustekinumab-treated subjects), 27% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (1.39 per subject-year of follow-up) compared with 24% of placebo-treated subjects (1.21 per subject-year of follow-up). Serious infections occurred in 0.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.01 per subject-year of follow-up) and in 0.4% of placebo-treated subjects (0.02 per subject-year of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In the controlled and non-controlled portions of plaque psoriasis clinical trials (median follow-up of 3.2 years), representing 8998 subject-years of exposure, 72.3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported infections (0.87 per subject-years of follow-up). Serious infections were reported in 2.8% of subjects (0.01 per subject-years of follow-up). Malignancies In the controlled and non-controlled portions of plaque psoriasis clinical trials (median follow-up of 3.2 years, representing 8998 subject-years of exposure), 1.7% of ustekinumab-treated subjects reported malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (0.60 per hundred subject-years of follow-up). Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.52 per hundred subject-years of follow-up) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The most frequently observed malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the clinical trials were: prostate, melanoma, colorectal and breast. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer in ustekinumab-treated subjects during the controlled and uncontrolled portions of trials were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender and race). 1 Pediatric Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in two trials of pediatric subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ps STUDY 3 evaluated safety for up to 60 weeks in 110 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years old. Ps STUDY 4 evaluated safety for up to 56 weeks in 44 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old. The safety profile in pediatric subjects was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults with plaque psoriasis. Psoriatic Arthritis The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 927 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA was consistent with the safety profile seen in adult psoriasis clinical-trials. A higher incidence of arthralgia, nausea, and dental infections was observed in ustekinumab-treated subjects when compared with placebo-treated subjects (3% vs. 1% for arthralgia and 3% vs. 1% for nausea; 1% vs. 0.6% for dental infections) in the placebo-controlled portions of the PsA clinical trials. Crohn's Disease The safety of ustekinumab was assessed in 1407 subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] greater than or equal to 220 and less than or equal to 450) in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trials. These 1407 subjects included 40 subjects who received a prior investigational intravenous ustekinumab formulation but were not included in the efficacy analyses. In trials CD-1 and CD-2 there were 470 subjects who received ustekinumab 6 mg/kg as a weight-based single intravenous induction dose and 466 who received placebo [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Subjects who were responders in either trial CD-1 or CD-2 were randomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either 90 mg ustekinumab every 8 weeks, or placebo for 44 weeks in trial CD-3. Subjects in these 3 trials may have received other concomitant therapies including aminosalicylates, immunomodulatory agents [azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate (MTX)], oral corticosteroids (prednisone or budesonide), and/or antibiotics for their Crohn's disease [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab was consistent with the safety profile seen in the adult psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical-trials . Common adverse reactions in trials CD-1 and CD-2 and in trial CD-3 are listed in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. Table 6: Common adverse reactions through Week 8 in Trials CD-1 and CD-2 occurring in ≥3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and higher than placebo Placebo Ustekinumab 6 mg/kg single intravenous induction dose N=466 N=470 Vomiting 3% 4% Other less common adverse reactions reported in subjects in trials CD-1 and CD-2 included asthenia (1% vs 0.4%), acne (1% vs 0.4%), and pruritus (2% vs 0.4%). Table 7: Common adverse reactions through Week 44 in Trial CD-3 occurring in ≥3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and higher than placebo Placebo N=133 Ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneous maintenance dose every 8 weeks N=131 Nasopharyngitis 8% 11% Injection site erythema 0 5% Vulvovaginal candidiasis/mycotic infection 1% 5% Bronchitis 3% 5% Pruritus 2% 4% Urinary tract infection 2% 4% Sinusitis 2% 3% Infections In subjects with Crohn's disease, serious or other clinically significant infections included anal abscess, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. In addition, listeria meningitis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one patient each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the Crohn's disease clinical-trials, 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.36 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.58 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.2% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.27 events per hundred patient-years) and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis In CD-trials, two subjects reported hypersensitivity reactions following ustekinumab administration. One patient experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (tightness of the throat, shortness of breath, and flushing) after a single subcutaneous administration (0.1% of subjects receiving subcutaneous ustekinumab). In addition, one subject experienced signs and symptoms consistent with or related to a hypersensitivity reaction (chest discomfort, flushing, urticaria, and increased body temperature) after the initial intravenous ustekinumab dose (0.08% of subjects receiving intravenous ustekinumab). These subjects were treated with oral antihistamines or corticosteroids and in both cases symptoms resolved within an hour. Ulcerative Colitis The safety of ustekinumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [IV induction] and UC-2 [SC maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The overall safety profile of ustekinumab in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of ustekinumab-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were: Induction (UC-1): nasopharyngitis (7% vs 4%). Maintenance (UC-2): nasopharyngitis (24% vs 20%), headache (10% vs 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs 3%), influenza (6% vs 5%), fever (5% vs. 4%), diarrhea (4% vs 1%), sinusitis (4% vs 1%), fatigue (4% vs 2%), and nausea (3% vs 2%). Infections In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Malignancies With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical-trials, 0.4% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of placebo-treated subjects (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of ustekinumab-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.40 events per hundred patient-years). 6.2 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ustekinumab or of other ustekinumab products. Approximately 6 to 12.4% of subjects treated with ustekinumab in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical trials developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were generally low-titer. In plaque psoriasis clinical trials, antibodies to ustekinumab were associated with reduced or undetectable serum ustekinumab concentrations and reduced efficacy. In plaque psoriasis trials , the majority of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 2.9% and 4.6% of subjects, respectively, developed antibodies to ustekinumab when treated with ustekinumab for approximately one year. No apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab and the development of injection site reactions was seen. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of ustekinumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ustekinumab product exposure. Immune system disorders: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), other hypersensitivity reactions (including rash and urticaria). Infections and infestations: Lower respiratory tract infection (including opportunistic fungal infections and tuberculosis). Neurological disorders: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) . Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia . Skin reactions : Pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, hypersensitivity vasculitis."

YESINTEK should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a healthcare provider. The appropriate dose should be determined by a healthcare provider using the patient's current weight at the time of dosing. In pediatric patients, it is recommended that YESINTEK be administered by a healthcare provider. If a healthcare provider determines that it is appropriate, a patient may self-inject or a caregiver may inject YESINTEK after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Instruct patients to follow the directions provided in the Medication Guide [see Medication Guide ] . It is recommended that each injection be administered at a different anatomic location (such as upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection, and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. When using the single-dose vial, a 1 mL syringe with a 27 gauge, ½ inch needle is recommended. Prior to administration, visually inspect YESINTEK for particulate matter and discoloration. YESINTEK is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution. Do not use YESINTEK if it is discolored or cloudy, or if other particulate matter is present. YESINTEK does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard any unused product remaining in the vial and/or syringe. 2.5 Instructions for Administration of YESINTEK Prefilled Syringes Equipped with Needle Safety Guard Refer to the diagram below for the provided instructions. Hold the BODY and remove the NEEDLE COVER. Do not hold the PLUNGER or PLUNGER HEAD while removing the NEEDLE COVER or the PLUNGER may move. Do not use the prefilled syringe if it is dropped without the NEEDLE COVER in place . Inject YESINTEK subcutaneously as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3) ] . Inject all of the medication by pushing in the PLUNGER until the PLUNGER HEAD is completely between the needle guard wings. Injection of the entire prefilled syringe contents is necessary to activate the needle guard . After injection, maintain the pressure on the PLUNGER HEAD and remove the needle from the skin. Slowly take your thumb off the PLUNGER HEAD to allow the empty syringe to move up until the entire needle is covered by the needle guard, as shown by the illustration below: Used syringes should be placed in a puncture-resistant container. Image Image Image 2.6 Preparation and Administration of YESINTEK 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial for Intravenous Infusion (Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) YESINTEK solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Calculate the dose and the number of YESINTEK vials needed based on patient weight (Table 4). Each 26 mL vial of YESINTEK contains 130 mg of ustekinumab-kfce. Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of YESINTEK to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of YESINTEK needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Alternatively, a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be used. Withdraw 26 mL of YESINTEK from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix. Visually inspect the diluted solution before infusion. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed. Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted, the infusion should be completely administered within four hours of the dilution in the infusion bag. Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Do not infuse YESINTEK concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. YESINTEK does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements. Storage If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) for up to 4 hours. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 4 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag (cumulative time after preparation including the storage and the infusion period). Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution."

Atopic Dermatitis Adults with Atopic Dermatitis Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and CHRONOS) and one dose-ranging trial (AD-1021) evaluated the safety of DUPIXENT in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . In terms of co-morbid conditions, 48% of the subjects had asthma, 49% had allergic rhinitis, 37% had food allergy, and 27% had allergic conjunctivitis. In these 4 trials, 1472 subjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of DUPIXENT, with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS). A total of 739 subjects were treated with DUPIXENT for at least 1 year in the development program for moderate-to-severe AD. SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021 compared the safety of DUPIXENT monotherapy to placebo through Week 16. CHRONOS compared the safety of DUPIXENT + TCS to placebo + TCS through Week 52. AD-1225 is a multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) trial which assessed the long-term safety of repeat doses of DUPIXENT through 260 weeks of treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in controlled trials of DUPIXENT or had been screened for SOLO 1 or SOLO 2. The safety data in AD-1225 reflect exposure to DUPIXENT 200 mg QW, 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W in 2677 subjects, including 2254 exposed for at least 52 weeks, 1224 exposed for at least 100 weeks, 561 exposed for at least 148 weeks and 179 exposed for at least 260 weeks. Weeks 0 to 16 (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, CHRONOS, and AD-1021) In DUPIXENT monotherapy trials (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021) through Week 16, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1.9% in both the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W and placebo groups. Table 7 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W monotherapy groups, and in the DUPIXENT + TCS group, all at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups during the first 16 weeks of treatment.

Two subjects discontinued DUPIXENT because of adverse reactions: atopic dermatitis (1 subject) and exfoliative dermatitis (1 subject). The safety profile of DUPIXENT + TCS through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 16. Safety through 260 Weeks (AD-1225) The long-term safety profile observed in this trial through 260 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile of DUPIXENT observed in controlled studies. Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Atopic Dermatitis The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in a trial of 250 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe AD (AD-1526). The safety profile of DUPIXENT in these subjects through Week 16 was similar to the safety profile seen in adults with AD. The long-term safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in an open-label extension study in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe AD (AD-1434). The safety profile of DUPIXENT in subjects followed through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at Week 16 in AD-1526. The long-term safety profile of DUPIXENT observed in pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older was consistent with that seen in adults with AD. Pediatric Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age with Atopic Dermatitis The safety of DUPIXENT with concomitant TCS was assessed in a trial of 367 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with severe AD (AD-1652). The safety profile of DUPIXENT + TCS in these subjects through Week 16 was similar to the safety profile from trials in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with AD. The long-term safety of DUPIXENT ± TCS was assessed in an open-label extension study of 368 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with AD (AD-1434). Among subjects who entered this study, 110 (30%) had moderate and 72 (20%) had severe AD at the time of enrollment in AD-1434. The safety profile of DUPIXENT ± TCS in subjects followed through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed through Week 16 in AD-1652. The long-term safety profile of DUPIXENT ± TCS observed in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age was consistent with that seen in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with AD. Pediatric Subjects 6 Months to 5 Years of Age with Atopic Dermatitis The safety of DUPIXENT with concomitant TCS was assessed in a trial of 161 pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD (AD-1539). The safety profile of DUPIXENT + TCS in these subjects through Week 16 was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults and pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with AD. The long-term safety of DUPIXENT ± TCS was assessed in an open-label extension study of 180 pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age with AD (AD-1434). The majority of subjects were treated with DUPIXENT 300 mg every 4 weeks. The safety profile of DUPIXENT ± TCS in subjects followed through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed through Week 16 in AD-1539. The long-term safety profile of DUPIXENT ± TCS observed in pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age was consistent with that seen in adults and pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older with AD. In addition, hand-foot-and-mouth disease was reported in 9 (5%) pediatric subjects and skin papilloma was reported in 4 (2%) pediatric subjects treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS. These cases did not lead to study drug discontinuation. Atopic Dermatitis with Hand and/or Foot Involvement The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial (Liberty-AD-HAFT) in 133 adult and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis with moderate-to-severe hand and/or foot involvement [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . In this trial 67 subjects received DUPIXENT, and 66 subjects received placebo. DUPIXENT-treated subjects received the recommended dosage based on their age and body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . The safety profile of DUPIXENT in these subjects through Week 16 was consistent with the safety profile from studies in adult and pediatric subjects 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe AD. Asthma Adults and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Asthma A total of 2888 adult and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma (AS) were evaluated in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (DRI12544, QUEST, and VENTURE). Of these, 2678 had a history of 1 or more severe exacerbations in the year prior to enrollment despite regular use of medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) (DRI12544 and QUEST). A total of 210 subjects with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus up to two additional controllers were enrolled (VENTURE). The safety population (DRI12544 and QUEST) was 12-87 years of age, of which 63% were female, and 82% were White. DUPIXENT 200 mg or 300 mg was administered subcutaneously Q2W, following an initial dose of 400 mg or 600 mg, respectively. In DRI12544 and QUEST, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 4% of the placebo group, 3% of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, and 6% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group. Table 8 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups in DRI12544 and QUEST. Table 8: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of Adult and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Asthma in the DUPIXENT Groups in DRI12544 and QUEST and Greater than Placebo (6 Month Safety Pool) Adverse Reaction DRI12544 and QUEST DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W Placebo N=779 n (%) N=788 n (%) N=792 n (%) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions cluster includes erythema, edema, pruritus, pain, and inflammation. 111 (14%) 144 (18%) 50 (6%) Oropharyngeal pain 13 (2%) 19 (2%) 7 (1%) Eosinophilia Eosinophilia = blood eosinophils ≥3,000 cells/mcL or deemed by the investigator to be an adverse event. None met the criteria for serious eosinophilic conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 17 (2%) 16 (2%) 2 (<1%) Injection site reactions were most common with the loading (initial) dose. The safety profile of DUPIXENT through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 24. Pediatric Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age with Asthma The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in 405 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma (VOYAGE). The safety profile of DUPIXENT in these subjects through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe asthma with the addition of helminth infections. Helminth infections were reported in 2.2% (6 subjects) in the DUPIXENT group and 0.7% (1 subject) in the placebo group. The majority of cases were enterobiasis, reported in 1.8% (5 subjects) in the DUPIXENT group and none in the placebo group. There was one case of ascariasis in the DUPIXENT group. All helminth infection cases were mild to moderate and subjects recovered with anti-helminth treatment without DUPIXENT treatment discontinuation. Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps A total of 722 adult subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) were evaluated in 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (SINUS-24 and SINUS-52). The safety pool consisted of data from the first 24 weeks of treatment from both studies. In the safety pool, the proportion of adult subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 5% of the placebo group and 2% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group. Table 9 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in adult subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis Adults and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with EoE A total of 239 adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older, weighing at least 40 kg, with EoE were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, including two 24-week treatment periods (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B) and received either DUPIXENT 300 mg QW or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 2% of the placebo group and 2% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg QW group. Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in Parts A and B. Table 10: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥2% of Adult and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with EoE Treated with DUPIXENT in a Placebo-Controlled Trial (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B; 24-Week Safety Pool) Study EoE-1 Parts A and B Adverse Reaction DUPIXENT 300 mg QW N=122 n (%) Placebo N=117 n (%) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions are composed of several terms including, but not limited to, injection site swelling, pain, and bruising. 46 (38%) 39 (33%) Upper respiratory tract infections Upper respiratory tract infections are composed of several terms including, but not limited to, COVID-19, sinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. 22 (18%) 12 (10%) Arthralgia 3 (2%) 1 (1%) Herpes viral infections Herpes viral infections are composed of oral herpes and herpes simplex. 3 (2%) 1 (1%) The safety profile of DUPIXENT in 72 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age, weighing at least 40 kg, and adults in Parts A and B was similar. Pediatric Subjects 1 to 11 Years of Age, Weighing at least 15 kg, with EoE A total of 61 pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age, weighing at least 15 kg, with EoE were evaluated in a randomized, blinded, parallel-group, multicenter trial, including an initial 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part A) and a 36-week extended active treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part B). Subjects in Part A received a weight-based dosing regimen of DUPIXENT or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . All subjects in Part B completed Part A and received active treatment with weight-based dosing regimens of DUPIXENT in Part B (N=47). The safety profile of DUPIXENT through Week 16 of Study EoE-2 Part A was generally similar to the safety profile in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with EoE. In Part B, a helminth infection was reported in one DUPIXENT-treated subject. Prurigo Nodularis A total of 309 adult subjects with prurigo nodularis (PN) were evaluated in two 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (PRIME and PRIME2) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The safety pool included data from the 24-week treatment and 12-week follow-up periods from both trials. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 3% of the placebo group and 0% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group. Subjects with co-morbid conditions included 43% of subjects with a history of atopy (defined as having a medical history of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhino conjunctivitis, asthma, or food allergy), 8% of subjects with a history of hypothyroidism and 9% of subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2. Table 11 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in PRIME and PRIME2.

Of those randomized, 1872 subjects received at least one dose of DUPIXENT 300 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W). The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in the pooled safety population from BOREAS and NOTUS, which consisted of 938 adult subjects treated with DUPIXENT. Of the subjects treated with DUPIXENT, 98% utilized inhaled triple therapy at baseline (comprising of an inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting beta-agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist), and 97% had chronic bronchitis. Table 12 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than placebo in BOREAS and NOTUS trials.

Among these subjects, serious cholecystitis was reported in 4 (0.4%) of the DUPIXENT group compared with 0% of the placebo group. Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria The pooled safety data below reflects the safety of DUPIXENT in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment. A total of 392 adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with CSU were evaluated for safety in three randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, studies, Study A, B, and C, conducted under a master protocol (CUPID) for 36 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] . The pooled safety population received an initial dose of DUPIXENT 600 mg or 400 mg, followed by DUPIXENT 300 mg or 200 mg, respectively, or matching placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W) [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] . Table 13 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than placebo in CUPID Study A, B and C (pooled safety population). Table 13: Adverse Reactions That Occurred in ≥2% of Adult and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with CSU Treated with DUPIXENT in CUPID Study A, B, and C (Pooled Safety Population) and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction CUPID Study A, B, and C DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W or 300 mg Q2W Placebo N=195 n (%) N=197 n (%) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions cluster includes injection site dermatitis, injection site erythema, injection site hematoma, injection site induration, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site reaction, injection site swelling 20 (10.3) 16 (8.1) Bullous Pemphigoid The safety of DUPIXENT was evaluated in a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (ADEPT) in a total of 106 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe bullous pemphigoid (BP) [see Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . Of the 106 randomized subjects, all received at least one dose of DUPIXENT or placebo with a course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) with a prespecified taper. At the time of analysis, 87 subjects had completed Week 36 and 65 subjects had completed Week 52. Table 14 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than placebo in the ADEPT trial.

Specific Adverse Reactions for AD, Asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, PN, COPD, CSU and BP Conjunctivitis and Keratitis In adult subjects with AD, conjunctivitis was reported in 10% (34 per 100 patient-years) in the 300 mg Q2W dose group and in 2% of the placebo group (8 per 100 patient-years) during the 16-week treatment period of the monotherapy trials (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021). During the 52-week treatment period of concomitant therapy AD trial (CHRONOS), conjunctivitis was reported in 16% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W + TCS group (20 per 100 patient-years) and in 9% of the placebo + TCS group (10 per 100 patient-years). During the long-term OLE trial with data through 260 weeks (AD-1225), conjunctivitis was reported in 21% of the DUPIXENT group (12 per 100 patient-years). In DUPIXENT AD monotherapy trials (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021) through Week 16, keratitis was reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 patient-years) and in 0% of the placebo group (0 per 100 patient-years). In the 52-week DUPIXENT + topical corticosteroids (TCS) AD trial (CHRONOS), keratitis was reported in 4% of the DUPIXENT + TCS group (4 per 100 patient-years) and in 2% of the placebo + TCS group (2 per 100 patient-years). Conjunctivitis and keratitis occurred more frequently in AD subjects who received DUPIXENT. Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported eye disorder. During the long-term OLE trial with data through 260 weeks (AD-1225), keratitis was reported in 3% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 patient-years). Most subjects with conjunctivitis or keratitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. Among subjects with asthma, the frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. In adult subjects with CRSwNP, the frequency of conjunctivitis was 2% in the DUPIXENT group compared to 1% in the placebo group in the 24-week safety pool; these subjects recovered. In the 52-week CRSwNP study (SINUS-52), the frequency of conjunctivitis was 3% in the DUPIXENT adult subjects and 1% in the placebo subjects; all of these subjects recovered. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the CRSwNP development program. Among subjects with EoE, there were no reports of conjunctivitis and keratitis in the DUPIXENT group in placebo-controlled trials. In the 36-week active treatment extension period of Study EoE-2 Part B, conjunctivitis was reported in 4% of DUPIXENT-treated pediatric subjects with EoE. Among subjects with PN, the frequency of conjunctivitis was 4% in the DUPIXENT group compared to 1% in the placebo group; all of these subjects recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the PN development program. Among subjects with COPD, the frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was 1.4% and 0.1% in the DUPIXENT group and 1% and 0% in the placebo group, respectively. Among subjects with CSU in the pooled safety population, the frequency of conjunctivitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the CSU development program. Among subjects with BP, the frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was 8% and 4% in the DUPIXENT group and 0% and 0% in the placebo group, respectively. Eczema Herpeticum and Herpes Zoster The rate of eczema herpeticum was similar in the placebo and DUPIXENT groups in the AD trials. The rates remained stable through 260 weeks in the long-term OLE trial (AD-1225). Herpes zoster was reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT groups (1 per 100 patient-years) and in <1% of the placebo group (1 per 100 patient-years) in the 16-week AD monotherapy trials. In the 52-week DUPIXENT + TCS AD trial, herpes zoster was reported in 1% of the DUPIXENT + TCS group (1 per 100 patient-years) and 2% of the placebo + TCS group (2 per 100 patient-years). During the long-term OLE trial with data through 260 weeks (AD-1225), 2.0% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects reported herpes zoster (0.94 per 100 patient-years of follow up). Among asthma subjects the frequency of herpes zoster was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. Among subjects with CRSwNP or EoE there were no reported cases of herpes zoster or eczema herpeticum. Among subjects with PN, herpes zoster and ophthalmic herpes zoster were each reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 patient-years) and 0% of the placebo group. Among subjects with COPD, herpes zoster was reported in 0.9% of the DUPIXENT group and 0.2% of the placebo group. Ophthalmic herpes zoster was reported in 0.1% of the DUPIXENT group and 0.2% of the placebo group. Among subjects with CSU in the pooled safety population, herpes zoster was reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT and placebo groups (1 per 100 patient-years). There were no cases of eczema herpeticum reported in the CSU development program. Among subjects with BP, herpes zoster was reported in 4% of the DUPIXENT group and 0% of the placebo group. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in <1% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects. These included anaphylaxis, AGEP, serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions, generalized urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum, and erythema multiforme [see Contraindications (4) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.6) ] . Eosinophils DUPIXENT-treated subjects with AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and COPD had a greater initial increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count compared to subjects receiving placebo. In adult subjects with AD (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 100 and 0 cells/mcL, respectively. In pediatric subjects less than 6 years old with AD, the mean and median increases from baseline to week 4 were 478 and 90 cells/mcL, respectively. In adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma (DRI12544 and QUEST), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 130 and 10 cells/mcL, respectively. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age with asthma (VOYAGE), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 12 were 124 and 0 cells/mcL, respectively. In adult subjects with CRSwNP (SINUS-24 and SINUS-52), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 16 were 150 and 50 cells/mcL, respectively. In subjects with COPD (BOREAS and NOTUS), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 8 were 60 and 0 cells/mcL, respectively. An increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count was not observed in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with EoE treated with DUPIXENT as compared to placebo (Study EoE-1). In pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age with EoE (Study EoE-2 Part A), blood eosinophil counts were generally consistent with those observed in Study EoE-1. In adult and pediatric subjects with CSU (CUPID Study A, Study B, and Study C) treated with DUPIXENT, an increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count was not observed compared to placebo at Week 12. In subjects with PN (PRIME and PRIME2), the mean and median decrease in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 9 and 10 cells/mcL, respectively. In DUPIXENT-treated subjects with BP in ADEPT, all of whom received background oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment, the mean and median decrease in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 1022 and 485 cells/mcL, respectively. In the trials for the COPD indication, treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥500 cells/mcL) was higher in DUPIXENT (41.7%) than in the placebo group (39.4%); none of the cases were associated with clinical symptoms, and treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥1000 cells/mcL) was higher in DUPIXENT (13.6%) than in the placebo group (8.1%). Across the trials for AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and CSU indications, the incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥500 cells/mcL) was similar in DUPIXENT and placebo groups. In the trials for the PN indication, the incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥500 cells/mcL) was lower in DUPIXENT than in the placebo group. In the trial for the BP indication, the incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥500 cells/mcL) was higher in DUPIXENT (21%) than in the placebo group (11%). Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥5,000 cells/mcL) was observed in <3% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects and <0.5% in subjects receiving placebo (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021; DRI12544, QUEST, and VOYAGE; SINUS-24 and SINUS-52; PRIME and PRIME2; BOREAS and NOTUS; CUPID Study A, B, and C). Blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline or remained below baseline levels (PRIME and PRIME2; BOREAS and NOTUS; ADEPT) during treatment. In trial AD-1539, treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in 8% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects and 0% in subjects receiving placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Cardiovascular Thromboembolic Events In the 1-year placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma (QUEST), cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.2%) of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, 4 (0.6%) of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group, and 2 (0.3%) of the placebo group. In the 1-year placebo-controlled trial in subjects with AD (CHRONOS), cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.9%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg Q2W group, 0 (0.0%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg QW group, and 1 (0.3%) of the placebo + TCS group. In the 24-week placebo-controlled trial in adult subjects with CRSwNP (SINUS-24), cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.7%) of the DUPIXENT group and 0 (0.0%) of the placebo group. In the 1-year placebo-controlled trial in adult subjects with CRSwNP (SINUS-52), there were no cases of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) reported in any treatment arm. In the 24-week placebo-controlled trial in subjects with EoE (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B), there were no cases of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) reported in any treatment arm. In the 24-week placebo-controlled trial in subjects with CSU (CUPID Study A, B, and C), there were no cases of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) reported in any treatment arm. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of DUPIXENT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: angioedema Musculoskeletal system disorders: psoriatic arthritis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Facial skin reactions, including erythema, rash, scaling, edema, papules, pruritus, burning, and pain; new-onset psoriasis, vasculitis"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Conjunctivitis and Keratitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 1%) are upper respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis, injection site reactions, and eosinophilia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact LEO Pharma Inc. at 1-877-494-4536 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults The safety of ADBRY was evaluated in a pool of 5 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in subjects with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis including three phase 3 Eczema Tralokinumab trials (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, and ECZTRA 3), a dose-finding trial, and a vaccine response trial. The safety population had a mean age of 37 years; 43% of subjects were female, 67% were White, 21% were Asian, and 9% were Black. In terms of co-morbid conditions, 39% of the subjects had asthma, 49% had hay fever, 36% had food allergy, and 21% had allergic conjunctivitis at baseline. In these 5 atopic dermatitis trials, 1964 subjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of ADBRY, with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS). A total of 807 subjects were treated with ADBRY for at least 1 year. ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 compared the safety of ADBRY monotherapy to placebo through Week 52. ECZTRA 3 compared the safety of ADBRY + TCS to placebo + TCS through Week 32. Weeks 0 to 16 (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, and ECZTRA 3): Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions identified in the pool of 3 trials (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2, and ECZTRA 3) and that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week monotherapy group, and in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week + TCS trial, all at a higher rate than placebo during the first 16 weeks of treatment. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of the ADBRY Monotherapy Group or the ADBRY + TCS Group in the Atopic Dermatitis Trials through Week 16 Adverse Reaction ADBRY Monotherapy Pooled analysis of ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2.

PLACEBO ADBRY 300 mg Q2W + TCS PLACEBO + TCS N=1180 n (%) N=388 n (%) N=243 n (%) N=123 n (%) Upper respiratory tract infections Upper respiratory tract infections cluster includes upper respiratory tract infection, viral upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, and nasopharyngitis; mainly reported as common cold. 281 (23.8) 79 (20.4) 73 (30.0) 19 (15.4) Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis cluster includes conjunctivitis and allergic conjunctivitis. 88 (7.5) 12 (3.1) 33 (13.6) 6 (4.9) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions cluster includes pain, erythema, and swelling. 87 (7.4) 16 (4.1) 27 (11.1) 1 (0.8) Eosinophilia Eosinophilia cluster includes eosinophilia and eosinophil count increased. 17 (1.4) 2 (0.5) 3 (1.2) 0 In the monotherapy trials (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) through Week 16, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.7% in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week group and 0% of the placebo group. In the concomitant TCS trial (ECZTRA 3) through Week 16, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.8% in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week +TCS group and 0% of the placebo + TCS group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the ADBRY group compared to the placebo group were injection site reaction (0.3% v. 0) and eosinophilia (0.3% v. 0) in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2; and injection site reaction (0.4% v. 0) and conjunctivitis (0.4% v. 0) in ECZTRA 3. Weeks 16-52 (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) and Weeks 16-32 (ECZTRA 3): The safety profile of ADBRY 300 mg every other week with or without TCS during maintenance treatment was consistent with that in the initial 16-week treatment period. In addition, the frequency of adverse reactions with ADBRY 300 mg every other week and every 4 weeks in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 was 44% and 34%, respectively, and 43% and 26% with ADBRY 300 mg + TCS every other week and every 4 weeks in ECZTRA 3, respectively. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older The safety of tralokinumab was assessed in a trial of 289 subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (ECZTRA 6). Of the 289 subjects, 195 were treated with ADBRY and 94 were treated with matching placebo. The safety profile of ADBRY in these subjects, assessed through the initial treatment period of 16 weeks and the long-term period of 52 weeks, was comparable to the safety profile from trials in adults with atopic dermatitis. Safety through 268 weeks (ECZTEND) ECZTEND was an open-label, multicenter, long-term extension trial that further assessed the safety of ADBRY for up to 5 years of treatment in adults and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who had previously participated in ADBRY trials. The safety data in ECZTEND reflect exposure to ADBRY in 1672 subjects who received 300 mg of ADBRY every two weeks (Q2W), including 1422 exposed for at least 52 weeks, 1184 exposed for at least 104 weeks, 701 exposed for at least 156 weeks, and 33 exposed for at least 264 weeks. The long-term safety profile was consistent with the safety profile observed up to week 16. Specific Adverse Reactions Conjunctivitis and Keratitis Conjunctivitis, including allergic conjunctivitis, was reported in 7.5% of subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every other week (29 events per 100 subject-years of exposure) and in 3.1% of subjects treated with placebo (12 events per 100 subject-years of exposure) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 trials. In the ADBRY group, 126 subjects reported 145 events of conjunctivitis, with 114 events resolved at the end of initial treatment period. Conjunctivitis led to discontinuation of treatment in 2 subjects. During the initial treatment period of the monotherapy trials (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2), conjunctivitis was reported in 7.7% of subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every other week (30 events per 100 subject-years of exposure). During the maintenance treatment period of the monotherapy trials (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) from 16 to 52 weeks, conjunctivitis was reported in 14 (8.9%) subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every other week (20 events per 100 subject-years of exposure) and in 10 (6.3%) subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every 4 weeks (14 events per 100 subject-years of exposure); and included no serious events, 1 severe event, and 1 event that led to discontinuation. A comparable pattern was seen during the continuation treatment period of an additional 16 weeks in the ADBRY combination trial ECZTRA 3. Keratoconjunctivitis (including 1 atopic keratoconjunctivitis (0.1%)) was reported in 5 (0.3%) subjects (1.2 events per 100 subject-years of exposure) treated with ADBRY and 0% of subjects treated with placebo during the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 trials. Keratoconjunctivitis was reported as resolved in 2 out of 5 subjects by the end of trials. Keratitis (including 1 ulcerative keratitis (0.1%)) was reported in 4 (0.2%) subjects treated with ADBRY (0.9 events per 100 subject-years of exposure) and 1 (0.2%) subject (viral keratitis) treated with placebo (0.6 events per 100 subject-years of exposure) during the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 trials. Keratitis was reported as resolved in all but 1 subject by the end of trials. None of the events were serious or led to treatment discontinuation. During the initial treatment period of the monotherapy trials (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2), keratitis event rate of 2 per 100 subject-years was reported for ADBRY 300 mg every other week. During the maintenance treatment period of the monotherapy trials (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2) from 16 to 52 weeks in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week group, keratitis was reported in 1 (0.6%) subject (ulcerative, severe, resolved after discontinuation) at an exposure-adjusted event rate of 1.2 per 100 subject-years, and keratoconjunctivitis (not serious or severe, resolved, not led to discontinuation) was reported in 3 (1.9%) subjects (3.6 events per 100 subject-years of exposure). No events of keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis was reported in ADBRY every 4 weeks or placebo groups. In the continuation treatment period of ECZTRA 3 (from 16 to 32 weeks), there were no additional events of keratitis reported for subjects randomized to ADBRY 300 mg + TCS. Eosinophil Counts ADBRY-treated subjects had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in eosinophil count compared to subjects treated with placebo. The mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 190 and 100 cells/mcL, respectively. The increase in the ADBRY-treated subjects declined to baseline level with continued treatment. Eosinophilia (> 5000 cells/mcL) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks was reported in 1.2% in the ADBRY-treated subjects and 0.3% in the placebo-treated subjects. The safety profile for subjects with eosinophilia was comparable to the safety profile for all subjects included in the pool of 5 atopic dermatitis trials."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MORTALITY, MALIGNANCY, MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, and THROMBOSIS SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be considered prior to RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ use. Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. The risks and benefits of treatment with RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ , including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. MORTALITY In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing another Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with the JAK inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . MALIGNANCIES Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with RINVOQ . In RA patients treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . THROMBOSIS Thrombos e s, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thrombosis , have occurred in patients treated for inflammatory conditions with J AK inhibitors , including RINVOQ . Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ in patients at risk. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should discontinue RINVOQ /RINVOQ LQ and be promptly evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MORTALITY, MALIGNANCY, MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (MACE), and THROMBOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Increased risk of serious bacterial, fungal, viral, and opportunistic infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis (TB). Interrupt treatment with RINVOQ / RINVOQ LQ if serious infection occurs until the infection is controlled. Test for latent TB before and during therapy; treat latent TB prior to use. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even patients with initial negative , latent TB test. ( 5.1 ) Higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death with another Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor vs. tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. ( 5.2 ) Malignancies have occurred in patients treated with RINVOQ. Higher rate of lymphomas and lung cancers with another JAK inhibitor vs. TNF blockers in RA patients.

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis A total of 3833 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with RINVOQ 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg tablets once daily in the Phase 3 clinical trials of whom 2806 were exposed for at least one year. Patients could advance or switch to RINVOQ 15 mg from placebo, or be rescued to RINVOQ from active comparator or placebo from as early as Week 12 depending on the trial design. A total of 2630 patients received at least 1 dose of RINVOQ 15 mg, of whom 1860 were exposed for at least one year. In trials RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-V, 1213 patients received at least 1 dose of RINVOQ 15 mg, of which 986 patients were exposed for at least one year, and 1203 patients received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib 30 mg, of which 946 were exposed for at least one year. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 1% of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated with RINVOQ 15 mg in Placebo-controlled Trials Adverse Reaction Placebo RINVOQ 15 mg N = 1042 (%) N = 1035 (%) Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)* 9.5 13.5 Nausea 2.2 3.5 Cough 1.0 2.2 Pyrexia 0 1.2 *URTI includes: acute sinusitis, laryngitis, nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, pharyngitis, pharyngotonsillitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, viral upper respiratory tract infection Other adverse reactions reported in less than 1% of patients in the RINVOQ 15 mg group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group through Week 12 included pneumonia, herpes zoster, herpes simplex (includes oral herpes), and oral candidiasis. Four integrated datasets are presented in the Specific Adverse Reaction section: Placebo-controlled Trials: Trials RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V were integrated to represent safety through 12/14 weeks for placebo (n=1042) and RINVOQ 15 mg (n=1035).

Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 8.16 mg/dL and 9.01 mg/dL. The mean LDL/HDL ratio remained stable. Mean triglycerides increased by 13.55 mg/dL and 14.44 mg/dL. Creatine Phosphokinase Elevations In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, dose-related increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values were observed. CPK elevations > 5 x ULN were reported in 1.0%, and 0.3% of patients over 12/14 weeks in the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Most elevations >5 x ULN were transient and did not require treatment discontinuation. In RA-III and RA-V, CPK elevations > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, 1.6% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and none in patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg. Neutropenia In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, dose-related decreases in neutrophil counts, below 1000 cells/mm 3 in at least one measurement occurred in 1.1% and <0.1% of patients in the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. In RA-III and RA-V, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1000 cells/mm 3 in at least one measurement occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, 1.3% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 2.4% of patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg. In clinical trials, treatment was interrupted in response to ANC less than 1000 cells/mm 3 . Lymphopenia In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, dose-related decreases in lymphocyte counts below 500 cells/mm 3 in at least one measurement occurred in 0.9% and 0.7% of patients in the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. In RA-III and RA-V, decreases in lymphocyte counts below 500 cells/mm 3 in at least one measurement occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with placebo, 0.5% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 2.4% of patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg. Anemia In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, hemoglobin decreases below 8 g/dL in at least one measurement occurred in <0.1% of patients in both the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups. In RA-III and RA-V, hemoglobin decreases below 8 g/dL in at least one measurement were observed in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, and none in patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis A total of 1827 adult patients with psoriatic arthritis were treated with RINVOQ 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg tablets once daily in clinical trials, representing 1639.2 patient-years of exposure, of whom 722 were exposed to upadacitinib for at least one year. In the two Phase 3 trials, 907 patients received at least 1 dose of RINVOQ 15 mg, of whom 359 were exposed for at least one year. Two placebo-controlled trials were integrated (640 patients on RINVOQ 15 mg once daily and 635 patients on placebo) to evaluate the safety of RINVOQ 15 mg in comparison to placebo for up to 24 weeks after treatment initiation. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with RINVOQ 15 mg was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. During the 24-week placebo-controlled period, the frequencies of herpes zoster and herpes simplex were ≥1% (1.1% and 1.4%, respectively) with RINVOQ 15 mg and 0.8% and 1.3%, respectively with placebo. A higher incidence of acne and bronchitis was also observed in patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg (1.3% and 3.9%, respectively) compared to placebo (0.3% and 2.7%, respectively). Adverse Reactions in Patients with Atopic Dermatitis Three Phase 3 (AD-1, AD-2, and AD-3) and one Phase 2b (AD-4) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials evaluated the safety of RINVOQ in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The majority of patients were White (68%) and male (57%). The mean age was 34 years (ranged from 12 to 75 years) and 13% of the patients were 12 to less than 18 years. In these 4 trials, 2612 patients were treated with RINVOQ 15 mg tablets or 30 mg tablets orally once daily, with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS). In the Phase 3 clinical trials (AD-1, AD-2, and AD-3), a total of 1239 patients received RINVOQ 15 mg, of whom 791 were exposed for at least one year and 1246 patients received RINVOQ 30 mg, of whom 826 were exposed for at least one year. Trials AD-1, AD-2, and AD-4 compared the safety of RINVOQ monotherapy to placebo through Week 16. Trial AD-3 compared the safety of RINVOQ + TCS to placebo + TCS through Week 16. Weeks 0 to 16 (Trials AD-1 to AD-4) In RINVOQ trials with and without TCS (Trials AD-1, 2, 3 and 4) through Week 16, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions in the RINVOQ 15 mg, 30 mg and placebo groups were 2.3%, 2.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in the RINVOQ 15 mg or 30 mg groups during the first 16 weeks of treatment.

Laboratory Abnormalities Hepatic Transaminase Elevations In studies UC-1, UC-2, and UC-4, elevations of ALT to ≥ 3 x ULN in at least one measurement were observed in 1.5% of patients treated with RINVOQ 45 mg, and 0% of patients treated with placebo for 8 weeks. AST elevations to ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with RINVOQ 45 mg, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo. Elevations of ALT to ≥ 5 x ULN occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with RINVOQ 45 mg and 0% of patients treated with placebo. In UC-3, elevations of ALT to ≥ 3 x ULN in at least one measurement were observed in 4.4% of patients treated with RINVOQ 30 mg, 2% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 1.2% of patients treated with placebo for 52 weeks. Elevations of AST to ≥ 3 x ULN in at least one measurement were observed in 2% of patients treated with RINVOQ 30 mg, 1.6% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo. Elevations of ALT to ≥ 5 x ULN were observed in 1.2% of patients treated with 30 mg, 0.4% of patients treated with 15 mg, and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo. Overall, laboratory abnormalities observed in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with RINVOQ were similar to those described in patients with RA. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Crohn’s Disease RINVOQ was studied up to 12 weeks in patients with moderately to severely active CD in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction studies (CD-1, CD-2). Long term safety up to 52 weeks was evaluated in patients who responded to induction therapy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance study (CD-3), with additional data provided from a long-term extension (LTE) period [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . In the two induction studies (CD-1, CD-2), 1021 patients were enrolled, of whom 674 patients received RINVOQ 45 mg tablets once daily during the placebo-controlled period. In the maintenance study (CD-3), 673 patients were enrolled, of whom 221 patients received RINVOQ 15 mg tablets once daily and 229 patients received RINVOQ 30 mg tablets once daily during the randomized, placebo-controlled period. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with Crohn’s disease treated with RINVOQ was consistent with the known safety profile for RINVOQ in other indications. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with RINVOQ and at a higher rate than placebo in the induction and maintenance studies are shown in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.

Discontinue treatment with CIBINQO if serious or opportunistic infection occurs. Test for latent TB before and during therapy; treat latent TB prior to use. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even patients with initial negative latent TB test. ( 5.1 ) • Higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, with another JAK inhibitor vs. TNF blockers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA patients. ( 5.2 ) • Malignancies have occurred with CIBINQO. Higher rate of lymphomas and lung cancers with another JAK inhibitor vs. TNF blockers in RA patients. ( 5.3 ) • MACE has occurred with CIBINQO. Higher rate of MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) with another JAK inhibitor vs. TNF blockers in RA patients. ( 5.4 ) • Thrombosis has occurred with CIBINQO. Increased incidence of pulmonary embolism, venous and arterial thrombosis with another JAK inhibitor vs. TNF blockers. ( 5.5 ) Serious Infections Patients treated with CIBINQO may be at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. The most frequent serious infections reported with CIBINQO were herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If a serious or opportunistic infection develops, discontinue CIBINQO and control the infection. Reported infections from Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions: • Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Test for latent TB before and during therapy; treat latent TB prior to use. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even patients with initial negative latent TB test. • Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. • Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. Avoid use of CIBINQO in patients with an active, serious infection including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment with CIBINQO should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infections. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIBINQO, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Mortality In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing another JAK inhibitor to TNF blocker treatment, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with the JAK inhibitor. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Malignancies Malignancies were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO. Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In RA patients treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Major adverse cardiovascular events were reported in patients treated with CIBINQO. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue CIBINQO in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Thrombosis Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients treated with CIBINQO. Thrombosis, including PE, DVT, and arterial thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid CIBINQO in patients at risk. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue CIBINQO and treat appropriately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (≥1% with CIBINQO 200 mg and greater than CIBINQO 100 mg) are nausea, headache, herpes simplex, increased blood creatine kinase, dizziness, urinary tract infection, acne, vomiting, gastroenteritis, upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, herpes zoster, and thrombocytopenia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of CIBINQO was evaluated in four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (2 monotherapy, 1 combination therapy with topical corticosteroid, and 1 dose-ranging) and one long-term extension trial in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). A total of 1623 subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were treated with CIBINQO in these clinical trials representing 1428 patient-years of exposure. There were 634 subjects with at least 1 year of exposure to CIBINQO. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, a total of 1198 subjects were exposed to CIBINQO with 608 subjects receiving CIBINQO 100 mg once daily and 590 subjects receiving CIBINQO 200 mg once daily for up to 16 weeks. The median age of subjects was 33.0 years, 124 subjects (8.1%) were 12 to less than 18 years old and 94 subjects (6.1%) were 65 years of age or older. The majority of subjects were White (68.7%) and male (53.9%). Adverse reactions occurring at ≥1% in any of the treated groups and at a higher rate than in the placebo group are presented in Table 3. A total of 61 (5.1%) subjects treated with CIBINQO were discontinued from the trials due to adverse reactions. The safety profile of CIBINQO in the monotherapy and the combination trial(s) were similar. Table 3.

Overall Infections In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, overall infections were reported in 90 subjects (126.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 211 subjects (168.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 204 subjects (159.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, overall infections were reported in 427 subjects (91.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 394 subjects (103.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Serious Infections In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, serious infections were reported in 2 subjects (2.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 6 subjects (3.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg, and 2 subjects (1.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, serious infections were reported in 18 subjects (2.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 16 subjects (2.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. The most commonly reported serious infections were herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and pneumonia. Herpes Zoster In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, opportunistic infections were generally cases of multidermatomal cutaneous herpes zoster. Herpes zoster was reported in 0 subjects treated with placebo, 3 subjects (1.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 8 subjects (5.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, herpes zoster was reported in 16 subjects (2.0 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 35 subjects (5.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Malignancy In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, no malignancy was reported in subjects treated with placebo or CIBINQO 100 mg and in 1 patient (0.65 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, malignancy was reported in 4 subjects (0.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 2 subjects (0.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Thrombosis In all clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, pulmonary embolism was reported in 3 subjects (0.4 per 100 patient-years), who were treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Deep vein thrombosis was reported in 2 subjects (0.3 per 100 patient-years) who were treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. No thrombosis occurred in subjects treated with CIBINQO 100 mg. Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was reported in 1 subject (0.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, MACE was reported in 1 patient (0.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 2 subjects (0.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Thrombocytopenia In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, treatment with CIBINQO was associated with a dose-related decrease in platelet count. Maximum effects on platelets were observed within 4 weeks, after which the platelet count returned towards baseline despite continued therapy. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, 6 subjects (0.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg had adverse reactions of thrombocytopenia; no subjects treated with CIBINQO 100 mg had an adverse reaction of thrombocytopenia. Lymphopenia In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, confirmed ALC <500/mm 3 occurred in 2 subjects (1.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg and 0 subjects treated with CIBINQO 100 mg or placebo. Both cases occurred in the first 4 weeks of exposure. Lipid Elevations In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, there was a dose-related percent increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) relative to placebo at Week 4 which remained elevated through the final visit in the treatment period. Adverse reactions related to hyperlipidemia occurred in 1 subject (0.6 per 100 patient-years) exposed to CIBINQO 100 mg, 3 subjects (2.0 per 100 patient-years) exposed to CIBINQO 200 mg. Retinal Detachment In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, retinal detachment occurred in 1 subject (0.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, retinal detachment occurred in 2 subjects (0.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg. Creatine Phosphokinase Elevations (CPK) In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, events of blood CPK increased were reported in 6 subjects (7.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 11 subjects (6.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with 100 mg of CIBINQO and 19 subjects (12.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with 200 mg of CIBINQO. Most elevations were transient, there were no reported adverse reactions of rhabdomyolysis. Pediatric Subjects (12 to less than 18 years of age) The safety of CIBINQO was assessed in a trial of 284 subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (Trial-AD-4). The safety profile of CIBINQO in these subjects, assessed through the initial treatment period of 12 weeks and the long-term period (213 with at least 52 weeks of abrocitinib exposure), was comparable to the safety profile from trials in adults with atopic dermatitis."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of SOTYKTU was evaluated in two placebo- and active-controlled trials (PSO-1 and PSO-2) and an open-label extension trial in which subjects who completed PSO-1 or PSO-2 could enroll [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In these clinical trials, a total of 1,519 subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy received SOTYKTU 6 mg orally once daily. Of these, 1,141 subjects were exposed to SOTYKTU for at least one year. In trials PSO-1 and PSO-2, 1,681 subjects were randomized to receive SOTYKTU 6 mg (840 subjects), placebo (419 subjects), or apremilast 30 mg twice daily (422 subjects). All subjects randomized to placebo switched to SOTYKTU at Week 16. All other subjects remained in their original treatment group until Week 24, at which point subjects could have continued on the same treatment or be switched to SOTYKTU or placebo. The mean age of subjects was 47 years. The majority of subjects were White (87%) and male (67%). In the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the pooled clinical trials (PSO-1 and PSO-2), discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions in subjects who received SOTYKTU was 2.4%, compared to 3.8% for placebo. Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the SOTYKTU group and at a higher rate than the placebo group during the 16-week controlled period. Table 1: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in ≥ 1% of Subjects with Plaque Psoriasis in the SOTYKTU Group and More Frequently than in the Placebo Group in Trials PSO-1 and PSO-2 through Week 16 a Includes upper respiratory tract infection (viral, bacterial, and unspecified), nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis (including viral, streptococcal, and unspecified), sinusitis (includes acute, viral, bacterial), rhinitis, rhinotracheitis, tracheitis, laryngitis, and tonsillitis (including bacterial, streptococcal) b Includes oral herpes, genital herpes, herpes simplex, and herpes virus infection c Includes mouth ulceration, aphthous ulcer, tongue ulceration, and stomatitis d Includes acne, acne cystic, and dermatitis acneiform Adverse Reaction SOTYKTU 6 mg once daily Placebo N=840 n (%) N=419 n (%) Upper respiratory infections a 161 (19.2) 62 (14.8) Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 23 (2.7) 5 (1.2) Herpes simplex b 17 (2.0) 1 (0.2) Mouth ulcers c 16 (1.9) 0 (0.0) Folliculitis 14 (1.7) 0 (0.0) Acne d 12 (1.4) 1 (0.2) Adverse reactions that occurred in < 1% of subjects in the SOTYKTU group were herpes zoster. Specific Adverse Reactions Exposure adjusted incidence rates are reported for all the adverse reactions presented below. Infections In the 16-week placebo-controlled period, infections occurred in 29% of the SOTYKTU group (116 events per 100 person-years) compared to 22% of the placebo group (83.7 events per 100 person-years). The majority of infections were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of SOTYKTU. In the 16-week placebo-controlled period, serious infections were reported in 5 subjects (2.0 per 100 patient-years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 2 subjects (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. The most common serious infections reported during the 52-week treatment period were pneumonia and COVID-19. Malignancies During the 0-to-52-week treatment period of the two clinical trials, PSO-1 and PSO-2 (total exposure of 986 patient-years with SOTYKTU), malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were reported in 3 subjects treated with SOTYKTU (0.3 per 100 patient-years), including single cases each of breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lymphoma after 24, 32, and 25 weeks of treatment, respectively. During PSO-1, PSO-2, and the open-label extension trial in which subjects who completed the controlled trials could enroll, a total of 3 subjects (0.1 per 100 patient-years), developed lymphoma while receiving SOTYKTU after 25, 77, and 98 weeks of treatment. Laboratory Abnormalities Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) In the 16-week placebo-controlled period, increased CPK (including Grade 4) was reported in 23 subjects (9.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 5 subjects (4.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. Liver Enzyme Elevations Events of increases in liver enzymes ≥3 times the ULN were observed in subjects treated with SOTYKTU [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . In the 16-week placebo-controlled period: • ALT elevations ≥3 times the ULN was reported in 9 subjects (3.6 per 100 patient- years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 2 subjects (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. • AST elevations ≥3 times the ULN was reported in 13 subjects (5.2 per 100 patient- years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 2 subjects (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. Decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) In the 16-week placebo-controlled period in subjects who had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min) at baseline, decreased GFR was reported in 4 subjects (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with SOTYKTU, and 1 subject (0.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo. Two of the deucravacitinib-treated subjects had worsening of baseline proteinuria. Lipid Elevations Mean triglycerides increased by 10.3 mg/dL during the 16-week treatment period in subjects treated with SOTYKTU and by 9.1 mg/dL during the 52-week treatment period. Safety Through Week 52 In PSO-1 and PSO-2, the exposure adjusted incidence rate of adverse reactions in subjects treated with SOTYKTU from Week 0 through Week 52 without switching treatment did not increase compared to the rate observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment."

      "WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MORTALITY, MALIGNANCY, MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, AND THROMBOSIS SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with oral Janus kinase inhibitors for inflammatory conditions are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis, and pneumocystosis. Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens. Avoid use of OPZELURA in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. If a serious infection develops, interrupt OPZELURA until the infection is controlled. The risks and benefits of treatment with OPZELURA should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with OPZELURA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . MORTALITY In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing an oral JAK inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker treatment, a h igher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with the JAK inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . MALIGNANCIES Malignancies were reported in patients treated with OPZELURA. Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In RA patients treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (MACE) In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE) ( defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) , was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue OPZELURA in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . THROMBOSIS Thromboembolic events were observed in trials with OPZELURA. Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid OPZELURA in patients at risk. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue OPZELURA and treat appropriately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MORTALITY, MALIGNANCY, MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (MACE), AND THROMBOSIS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis and bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients receiving Janus kinase inhibitors for inflammatory conditions.
