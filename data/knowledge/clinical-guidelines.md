# Biologic Dose Reduction in Psoriasis

## Eligibility Criteria for Dose Reduction
- PASI ≤5 maintained for ≥6 months
- PGA 0-1 maintained for ≥6 months  
- DLQI ≤5
- No recent disease flares

## Evidence Base
- CONDOR Trial (2020): 59% maintained response at reduced dosing for 1 year, 69% for 2 years
- van Riel et al. (2024): Only 27% relapsed over 102 months with dose reduction
- Relapse definition: PASI >5 or PGA ≥2

## Recommended Protocols
### TNF Inhibitors (Adalimumab)
- Standard: 40mg Q2W
- Reduced: 40mg Q3W, then Q4W
- Monitor: PASI at 3, 6, 12 months

### IL-17 Inhibitors (Secukinumab, Ixekizumab)
- Standard: Q4W
- Reduced: Q6W, then Q8W
- GUIDE trial: Q8W non-inferior to Q4W in complete responders

### IL-23 Inhibitors (Risankizumab, Guselkumab)
- Standard: Q8W (risankizumab), Q8W (guselkumab)
- Reduced: Q12W
- Blauvelt 2020: 61% maintained remission 52 weeks after stopping

## Safety
- No increased adverse events with dose reduction
- 80-96% regain response if relapse occurs by returning to standard dosing
