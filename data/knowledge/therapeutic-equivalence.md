# Therapeutic Equivalence in Dermatology Biologics

## IL-17 Inhibitors (Comparable Efficacy)
- Secukinumab (Cosentyx) 300mg Q4W
- Ixekizumab (Taltz) 80mg Q2W (Q4W after loading)
- Head-to-head PASI 90 rates: 50-65% at Week 12

## IL-23 Inhibitors (Comparable Efficacy)
- Risankizumab (Skyrizi) 150mg Q12W after loading
- Guselkumab (Tremfya) 100mg Q8W after loading
- PASI 90 rates: 70-75% at Week 16

## TNF Inhibitors
- Adalimumab (and biosimilars) 40mg Q2W
- Etanercept 50mg weekly
- Generally less effective than IL-17/IL-23 for psoriasis
- PASI 75 rates: 50-60%

## Mechanistic Switching
- If TNF fails → try IL-17 or IL-23
- If IL-17 fails → try IL-23 or TNF
- If IL-23 fails → try IL-17 or TNF
