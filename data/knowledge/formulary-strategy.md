# Formulary-Aligned Prescribing Strategy

## Tier Optimization Principles
1. Tier 1 preferred (lowest cost, no PA)
2. Tier 2 acceptable if clinically superior or Tier 1 failed
3. Tier 3 only if Tier 1 & 2 failed or contraindicated

## Step Therapy Considerations
- Document failures of required steps in PA
- Medical exception criteria:
  - Contraindication to step therapy drugs
  - Previous failure documented in claims
  - Severe disease requiring rapid control
  
## Prior Authorization Strategy
- Pre-emptive documentation reduces denial risk
- Include: PASI/EASI scores, DLQI, photos, failed treatments
- Appeal success rate: 22% → 50%+ with comprehensive documentation
